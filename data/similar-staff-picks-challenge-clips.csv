In a world where live-action and animation are growing closer and closer to one another, Richard Williams was and still is one of the last remaining members of the old guard who wanted to push animation in the exact opposite direction, to do what no other medium can, and that's perhaps most evident in the masterful way in which his films move. Let's dive in and see what we can learn.

15,247839331,SUPERPOSITION,"To optimize your experience,you can use headset and light free environment with fullscreen resolution.

Superposition is an experimental short film. “Superposition"" is actually the “quantum theory that describes a challenging concept about the nature and behavior of matter and forces at the sub-atomic level. The principle of superposition claims that while we do not know what the state of any object is, it is actually in all possible states simultaneously, as long as we don't look to check. It is the measurement itself that causes the object to be limited to a single possibility”.  In the film, the character desires to break that possibility, she experienced it infinitely but the chances of her breaking single possibility are equal to herself. Every time she is born, she becomes conscious all over again and she doesn’t even know who she is and what she has to do. She is part of the environment but she just doesn’t want to be. She lives in pure white and just wants to live in a little bit of grey. However, if you live in a world where the answers are obvious, a little bit of grey can change the whole picture. One day when you look for the place you last put your key, the universe might collapse until you find it.

Tuscan cuisine, incredible boutique shopping, and mesmerizing views at every turn, the city of Florence is nothing short of spectacular. Known worldwide as the birthplace of the Renaissance, Florence embodies the spirit of ancient Italy and has managed to preserve it for nearly 700 years. With over 350,000 who call the city home, and nearly 1.5 million who reside in its surrounding metropolitan area, Florence skillfully fuses the past with the present, creating a unique time capsule of ancient aesthetics housed within a hustling, bustling world of modern day Italy.
Containing a wealth of preserved artistic and architectural masterpieces, the city is home to almost one-third of the world’s artistic treasures, according to UNESCO, an organization which designates world heritage sites to preserve the world’s most important cultural locations and artifacts. With a near countless number of art galleries and over 45 museums – including the Uffizi gallery, the world’s best collection of Italian Renaissance art, and the Galleria dell'Accademia, home to the legendary statue of David – it is no wonder why the city captures the hearts and imaginations of all who visit. From the ancient churches and stunning buildings that line the city streets to the priceless artistic masterpieces created by Michelangelo, Botticelli, and Giotto housed within Florence’s galleries, the city is bursting with art and culture.
Florence’s influence can be felt in more than just the world of art. The capital of the region of Tuscany, Florence is the birthplace of the Italian language. It was famed Italian author Dante Alighieri and other writers such as Boccaccio and Petrarca who were the first to begin writing in a language other than Latin. Florence was also the first city in all of Europe to have paved streets. With its rich history and incomparable influence on modern Italian life, Florence certainly changed the way that most view Italy.

Una città che ha mantenuto inalterato il proprio fascino e lo splendore del passato. Così si presenta Firenze, capoluogo della Toscana. Una città incantevole che non smette mai di sorprendere, con i suoi capolavori d’arte, i marmi colorati delle chiese e le architetture che ne rievocano il fasto e il ruolo svolto nello sviluppo della cultura e dell’arte rinascimentale.
Cuore pulsante di Firenze è Piazza del Duomo, con il complesso monumentale della Basilica di Santa Maria del Fiore - sormontato dalla maestosa cupola del Brunelleschi -, il Battistero di San Giovanni - magnifico esempio di romanico fiorentino -, il Campanile di Giotto - un capolavoro di architettura gotica fiorentina.
Alle spalle del Duomo sorge il Museo dell’Opera di Santa Maria del Fiore, dove è possibile ammirare una preziosa raccolta di opere provenienti dalla Cattedrale, dal Battistero e dal Campanile.
Piazza della Signoria rappresenta il polo storico della vita civile e ospita la trecentesca Loggia dei Lanzi, la Fontana di Nettuno e il Palazzo della Signoria o Palazzo Vecchio, uno dei monumenti-simbolo della città, davanti al quale sorgono alcune famose statue tra cui una copia del famoso David di Michelangelo.
Accanto alla piazza vi è la maestosa Galleria degli Uffizi, sede di uno dei musei più importanti del mondo, che include opere di Botticelli, Michelangelo, Leonardo da Vinci e molti altri grandi artisti. Elemento architettonico di particolare rilievo della Galleria è il Corridoio Vasariano progettato dal Vasari alla metà del Cinquecento che collega la struttura con Palazzo Vecchio e con Palazzo Pitti.",2017-12-18T10:51:13-05:00,486448886,178,247820432,36,40381,1149,https://i.vimeocdn.com/video/673174954_780x439.webp

25,244729509,THE BAIL PROJECT,"The Bronx Freedom Fund pays the bail for people accused of misdemeanors who cannot afford their freedom. Who are these people? They are often the most vulnerable in our community and those with the least public voice. They are people like Ramel. 
 
Having Ramel share his story with us was transformative – to be innocent and have your liberty denied is a national shame. His story galvanized us to make this film because his voice not only deserves to be heard, but needs to be heard. His courage, resolve and compassion is an inspiration and it’s time to shine a light on this grave injustice being visited upon far too many of our fellow citizens. 
 
The Bronx Freedom Fund, and now the national Bail Project, is doing their part – Ramel’s story is a stirring reminder that it’s up to all of us to step up and do ours.

The Bail Project is an unprecedented national effort to combat mass incarceration by keeping tens of thousands of low-income Americans out of pretrial detention. The organization grows out of The Bronx Freedom Fund and will expand to dozens of high-need jurisdictions with the goal of reducing the unacceptable human suffering caused by unaffordable cash bail and supporting community efforts to end the racial disparities endemic to this system.

34,242337463,500 MILES,"TEXT 500MILES TO 71777 TO DONATE AND SUPPORT OUR MISSION

The purpose of this innovative short film is to start a new, universally-understood conversation around the necessity of struggle, challenge and perseverance as they relate to creating meaning in one's life - without one, you cannot have the other. The 500 Miles film communicates the importance of this concept by telling the story of the un-purposed wild mustang and the un-purposed veteran, following both as they learn to face and navigate challenges, with the ultimate goal of discovering what their greater purpose in life is. For these mustangs, the arduous 500 mile journey through New Mexico and Arizona was their purpose-defining challenge, but we all have our own version of a ""500 mile journey"". It's the moments in life when we choose to buck up instead of give up. When we choose to take the unbeaten path instead of the easy road. It's the moments that force us to take a hard look at ourselves, and the decisions we have been making, and decide if we have been letting life happen to us, or for us.

So, the question is: What's your 500?

“We travel along the coastline for several days. All we need fits in our waterproof and floatable backpacks. We set out to explore nature and what we carry with us is reduced to a minimum. We dive deep into the ocean and swim along wild cliffs, discovering untouched beaches where we spend our nights under the clear sky.”        - Bernhard Wache, Founder of Seatrekking.

It has been almost twelve years since Bernhard and a group of friends started developing a new sport they ended up naming SEATREKKING. It began with the simple idea of spending as much time as possible near and in the ocean.

Over the years Seatrekking became more than a sport. It became a philosophy.

41,241055783,"""Lovers Sleep Together"" -- Sneak Preview Episode of 'The Eyeslicer'","""One of the craziest TV shows you'll ever see. It could revolutionize short film distribution."" -Indiewire

Fresh off its premiere at the 2017 Tribeca Film Festival, THE EYESLICER is a new hourlong 'secret TV show' from the bizarre minds of Dan Schoenbrun and Vanessa McDonnell (COLLECTIVE:UNCONSCIOUS). Like an Internet-age spiritual successor to MTV’s beloved 120 MINUTES & LIQUID TELEVISION, this ten-episode series aims to create an online safe haven for boundary-pushing, transgressive, proudly weird American filmmaking. 

From vérité documentary to amateur computer animation; surreal horror to remix video art; haunted high school yearbooks to Sasquatch birth rituals; time traveling cats to live web streams of your own birth -- if it sounds too strange for Netflix, chances are you'll find it on THE EYESLICER.

To watch the full ten-episode, ten-hour first season of The Eyeslicer for the price of an email address, visit http://www.theeyeslicer.com/secret_code and answer the following trivia question: Who does 'Twin Peaks' and 'Sunset Boulevard' have in common? (answer in one-word, all-caps).

""Lovers Sleep Together"" is the 8th episode of the series. It's all about love, relationships, and sex. It features:

That is a personal project that have been made as an extension for commercial project. At a spring 2017 I was helping ONY studio to present their project for the Tretyakov Gallery. One part of it was a cg-short with spray cans flying around in a for of letter T — the main element of a new id-system that ONY had made for the Gallery. The point was to complement a real camera shot and make a sort of transition to cg-graphic so we could easily present the id-style on different mediums using cg. After work was done I have challenged myself to do a similar short for every Gallery's direction — classic paintings, modern art, franchise and others — which presented by seven colours in id-system.",2017-10-24T04:56:23-04:00,355800796,108,239604078,10,326178,920,https://i.vimeocdn.com/video/662905002_780x439.webp

The area is changing. People are disappearing. What has that got to do with coffee?

Written and directed by actor and playwright Nathaniel Martello White, CLA’AM is a short film about a man who notices that his area is changing and suspects that darkness may be afoot. As Hog, a long time resident of a certain south London district known as Cla’am searches for his friend JJ, he starts to see patterns and signs pointing to a mysterious plot. But no one will listen to him. As the mystery deepens CLA’AM is the story of Hog’s mission to expose the conspiracy, and save his friend. Is it all in his head? Or might the disappearance of the locals really be somehow connected to all the new coffee shops.

65,237715420,A Young Caregiver’s Letter to Her Father with Alzheimer’s,"When Melissa’s Dad was diagnosed with early-onset Alzheimer’s, she was only 14 years old. 

It changed the family dynamics, and she was forced to grow up to take on the responsibility of a caregiver for her Dad. “Our roles reversed,” she said. “I had to be the parent.” 

We tend to think of dementia as a condition that primarily affects older persons, and issues of early-onset are often overlooked, including its impact on family members.   

The challenges that young caregivers face are unique, especially with having to cope with the struggles of adolescence, alongside competing demands of school and caregiving.

Melissa is working to address this gap through Project We Forgot, a community platform she kickstarted, which offers support for young caregivers of persons with dementia. 

Melissa wished that she was more informed about her Dad’s condition so that she could be a better caregiver, amidst having to come to terms with his memory loss and confusion.

“No one taught us how to feel when we watched you slowly slip away, or how to react when your memories started fading, and you stopped remembering who we were.” 

She wrote these words in a letter to her Dad more than ten years later. Had she known better as a teenager, perhaps there could have been more empathy and understanding.   

There was no one she could confide with in school, seeing that there was hardly any awareness about issues of dementia amongst her circle of friends and teachers.

With lessons learned from her own experience, Melissa hopes that young caregivers won’t have to feel the same isolation like she did. Through Project We Forgot, they can access resources and be connected with others who are going through similar journeys.

At the same time, Melissa actively reaches out to different institutions around Singapore to help raise awareness and support for the needs of caregivers at school or the workplace. 

Meaningful change can only happen when there’s increased public education, she feels. 

Reflecting on her journey, Melissa sees a large part of her Dad in who she is now, especially his entrepreneurial spirit, which gave her the impetus to kickstart Project We Forgot.

“I hope that I’m doing you proud, Dad.” She tells him as she ends her letter.

66,232362579,The Big Picture | Lite Years,"Hello, thanks for tuning in.
The show's about to begin.

What you are about to see,
is The Big Picture's first ever movie.

After three years and sixteen web edits down,
we thought it was time to change things around.

We called up the dudes, and told them the news.
They put down their brews, and loaded the doos.

With two-stroke and pillows, big air and big crashes.
Literal close friends, two dudes on one mattress.

Join the Logans, Rainville, King, Adams and White,
on a powder filled party, assured to leave you in delight.

So turn up the volume, lets all have a cheer.
We are The Big Picture and this is Lite Years.

70,238096496,THE LOCAL: The Master Carver,"In this pilot film, we follow Master carver and indigenous Alaskan artist Wayne Price as he creates fine art in the traditional style of the Tlingit people. Wayne’s artistic creations cover a broad range of design and artifacts, including totem poles, dugout canoes, masks, paddles, clan hats and jewelry. Wayne works with local youth to pass on the craft and culture of the Tlingit people. Wayne takes us on a journey as he builds an adze, a traditional Tlingit wood-carving tool used by his ancestors for thousands of years.

The Local is a Royal Caribbean original series, celebrating people from around the world, their unique passions and their culture. 
For the premiere season, we highlight three locals from Alaska: Wayne Price, Mary Smith and Dan Oberlatz.

88,235331938,TRANS-SIBERIAN · TRANS-MONGOLIAN,"This is a short film on the centenary Trans-Siberian Railway. We embarked August 2017 expecting to live a romantic long train journey, but it wasn’t only that: we enjoyed 2 weeks of absorbing and great experiences, both on the train and in the cities we visited. We departed from Moscow and stopped in Ekaterinburg, Irkutsk, Baikal Lake and Ulan-Ude, the formerly closed city in which we took the Trans-Mongolian route to UlaanBaatar to after visit the spectacular Mongolian countryside.
101 years after it was completed, the Trans-Siberian still keeps the tranquility and nostalgia of an historical ride.

About SOLO NYC:

In the alleyways, back kitchens and matchbox studios tucked away in countless of bustling, yet remarkably unglamorous, neighborhoods wedged within the most vibrant city in the world, there’s magic is happening. Every damn day.

New York’s professional style understated yet relentless. Showing up, doing your best—and doing things a little differently—is the mantra of millions of people who rise with the sun to chase their dreams. With a little luck and a lot of sweat, millions of men and women are making their career ambitions happen, and doing so outside of the traditional career path.

133,226788946,Dolby 'Prime' Full Version,"This is actually the fourth and final part in a series of films commissioned by Dolby Labs for their amazing gallery space in San Francisco. Gabe Askew has long collaborated with the musician duo Hays + Ryan Holladay who were responsible for putting the series together. They leveraged the new Dolby Atmos technology to create a beautiful and embracing soundscape while Gabe tried to wrap his head around the massive 9920x720 resolution display. The theme of the series was memory. Drawing from the writings of Ray Kurzweil, Gabe created a visual metaphor for the physical act of how the brain receives a stimulus, breaks it down into elements, stores it via pattern receptors in the cerebral cortex, and then recalls it. The specific memory represented in the film is the birth of his daughter, Lily.

135,226771837,FRANCO PASCALI,"When I met Franco Pascali, I was struck by how much I felt like I was meeting and hanging out with a young street skater. However, instead of witnessing skate tricks he destroyed me by his usage of cards. Much like the world of skateboarding that I was raised in, magic and cardistry are intensely personal and individually orientated in terms of the endless practice that is required to master them. Tricks are performed with decks and each person embodies a style that is distinctly their own. That style is reflective of the influences they devoured when they were coming up and their intrinsic sensibility that they develop as they mature. As I spent time with Franco I immediately wanted to point my camera at him to capture the way he dressed, the way he talked, the breathtaking way he moved cards and the feeling I had in encountering such raw talent. This is our first film.

Franco Pascali is 19 years-old and lives in Los Angeles. He is a director of magic at Theory11.

136,225956849,EPIC FAIL,"In a time where post-truth news divides and conservative politics fails to lure in young voters, a extraordinary vote for world peace has dramatic consequences.
Epic Fail is an avant-garde essay that questions how we perceive truth, information and politics, seen through the dual lenses of our real and virtual identities.

Moved by the political events that shook 2016, the film is inspired by Jean Paul Sartre’s “Nausea”; or how we can develop visual embodiments of our emotions as a catharsis on how to deal with reality.

In this vibrant visual poem we observe a young man and woman and hear them discuss these universal reflections. They don’t have any final answers - just a lot ‘ifs’. The frustrating beauty of life.

164,222706185,Why we need net neutrality,"Join the fight for a free, open, weirdo internet: https://www.battleforthenet.com

The FCC is planning to repeal the strong net neutrality rules that we fought so hard to get in 2015. Why do we care? Vimeo is the home to so many makers, watchers, and all-around internet video lovers. Net neutrality makes sure there is room for creativity and equal access for any internet user. File comments with the FCC and spread the word to keep our internet free, open, and wondrously creative. #netneutrality

In 2014, The Glasgow School of Art’s Mackintosh building, a symbol of British art, was reduced to ash.

25 world-famous artists including Grayson Perry, David Shrigley and Sir Antony Gormley were asked to turn a piece of charcoal salvaged from the Mackintosh Building fire into art. The work was auctioned at Christie’s to fund the rebuild.

The film was commissioned by J. Walter Thompson (JWT London) and produced at Jelly London.

Ash To Art animation is shortlisted in the Animation category at Cannes Lions 2017.

169,221441846,Symmetry: Behind the laws of nature,"Symmetry underlines our whole understanding of the universe. And the deeper we look, the more symmetries we find, reflecting our world in new and beautiful ways. 

Symmetry is vital to understanding and predicting how our universe works. The relationship between symmetry and the mechanics of the universe is fundamental to physics. From Noether’s theorem to the new and exciting world of local symmetries being revealed by modern day physics, Tara Shears explores the physics of symmetry.

By revealing nature’s parameters, symmetry gives definition to the world as we understand it. It is a fundamental principle that makes phenomena repeatable and predictable.  But if symmetries are so pervasive and influential in our world, why do we see so much asymmetry and chaos?

**Winner of Worldfest Huston International Film Festival 2017**
""Travelling Through Brush and Ink"" is a stop-motion animation of a little modern man traveling through four significant ancient Chinese paintings, transforming himself into animals and plants, and becomes part of the nature. Each painting represents four important stages of landscape art in Chinese history. Based on the original paintings, we built the sets and animated little character inside- all frame by frame. The animation is the opening film of 2016 annual exhibition National Palace Museum Taiwan.

**2017休士頓國際影展動畫獎得主**
“筆墨行旅”故事敘述一個現代男子進入畫中世界展開旅程，在旅程中形變成動物或植物，與自然合而為一。動畫中的四個場景分別為四幅歷史上重要的中國山水畫，畫中景色被製作成真實模型場景，人物和動植物在其中全是逐格拍攝。
四幅畫分別為唐代〈明皇幸蜀圖〉、北宋〈谿山行旅圖〉、南宋〈巖關古寺〉及元代〈鵲華秋色圖〉，呈現中國山水畫講求可行、可望、可遊、可居之意境，為中國山水畫的歷代風格演變的代表。本動畫是台灣國立故宮博物院2016年度典藏展的開幕片。

2017 Great Big Story Awards - “Story that Inspires Hope” Award 
2017 Hatch Awards - Best Use of Branded Content (Silver)

In the wake of Katrina, New Orleans’ Lower Ninth Ward was one of the few neighborhoods where relief came slowly. Less than 25% of its pre-Katrina population has returned and many houses have been abandoned or mowed down. As a result, the USDA officially listed the neighborhood as a “food desert”, defined as urban areas without access to affordable food in a five-mile radius.

Burnell Cotlon returned to his home neighborhood in 2007 and was dismayed by what he saw. He pleaded with major chain stores to open up in the Ward, but the ongoing reconstruction and slow repopulation kept them away.

Cotlon decided he’d open up his own shops and restore the community one small business at a time. He learned carpentry and electrical work through YouTube videos so that he could build all his operations on a budget. To date, he’s opened a grocery store, a market, a barbershop, and a laundromat all in an effort to centralize and revitalize pride for the Ward.

When you express yourself purely, simply. There’s greatness in simplicity, but it isn’t simple.

191,193330065,張靓潁Jane Zhang - Dust My Shoulders Off -MV,"*影像工作邀約來信請至 (Outerspace studio)
Any work invitations please mail us: 
fxxkleo@hotmail.com 

Singer Zhang Liangying, portrays the role of an office lady and was presented at the beginning of the story. This unlucky lady was blamed by her boss over the phone when she visited the Art Institute of Chicago. Suddenly, she enters a world of famous paintings, and was on her way to a fantastic adventure.

In this MV, we try to connect 12 world-known paintings through interesting and smooth transitions. The original values of those paintings are re-defined. For example, Van Gogh’s ear is bitten by Mike Tyson; when the girl in the Gleaners looks up, she becomes the Girl with A Pearl Earring; the two men in black at the end of the bridge in the Scream by Edvard Munch are actually MIB, and they scream because they see the big monster in the painting of Dali; and the man in suit sitting with his back to us in the lonely café of the last painting Nighthawks, is Dali, and so on.

The 3D effect of those famous paintings is the largest challenge in this MV. We invited excellent artists to contribute their ideas and skills on all the scenes, costumes, actors and the singer. The innovative shooting methods are extremely experimental, which seems crazy!

Although the concept of the script is radical, weird and wild, the revival of paintings, the integration of the new and the old, the copy of painting lines and the texture presentation in the production process are all challenges. The traditional arts and aesthetics are supported by creativity, and innovative story line and the overwhelming CG are integrated. The MV was made possible through the efforts of experts in various fields. We hope you enjoy it!

The list of paintings and artists used in the MV:
1. Edward Hopper – Nighthawks
2. Vincent Willem van Gogh
3. Jean-François Millet- Des glaneuses
4. Johannes Vermeer-Het meisje met de parel
5.Andrew Nowell Wyeth-Christina's World
6.Georges-Pierre Seurat-Un dimanche après-midi à l'Île de la Grande Jatte
7. Edvard Munch-Skrik
8.alvador Dali-A Tentação de Santo Antônio
9. The marches of summer
10. Maurits Cornelis Escher-Ascending and descending
11. Maurits Cornelis Escher- Gallery
12. Magritte Rene-The Son of Man
13. Salvador Dali

* As for the 13th painting, the explosion at 1:35 of the MV adopts the style of Japanese artist, Yayoi Kusama.


故事的開始，從歌手張靚穎所扮演的OL上班族拉開序幕，電話那頭傳來老闆的責駡，正在逛芝加哥美術館( Art Institute of Chicago)的倒楣OL，莫名闖入名畫的世界，展開一連串不可思議的奇幻冒險。

此MV我們嘗試以有趣流暢的轉場,貫穿12幅世界名畫，並且顛覆改寫原先名畫的世界觀，做出了全新的定義，例如：梵谷的耳朵原來是被拳王泰森給咬下來的、拾穗中間彎著腰的女性抬起頭來，原來是戴珍珠耳環的少女、孟克吶喊那座橋後方的兩個黑衣人原來是MIB，而吶喊的原因是看到了達利畫中的巨大神獸所以尖叫吶喊、而最後名畫Nighthawks寂寞咖啡廳裡背對西裝男，竟然是達利的背影……等等。

為了讓平面經典以3D重現，將名畫""立體化""是此次MV最大的挑戰，我們找來了優秀的藝術畫家們，將所有看的到的搭景、服裝、甚至演員與歌手全都畫上了""筆觸""，""極不正常""的MV拍攝手法，極度實驗性的拍攝現場，只有瘋狂！

雖然劇本創意不按牌理出牌，也可以說非常""前衛另類＆狂野""，但回歸現實製作層面，如何呈現畫作本質並賦予新的生命，新舊衝突的融合、筆觸的臨摹、質感呈現更是實際我們要克服的一大挑戰。以正統藝術與美感為基底，創意為輔，融入超展開的惡搞劇情，加上目不暇給的CG動畫特效，這是各方專業跨界努力後的成果，請開心享用!

此外，值得一提的是歌手張靚穎的勇氣與野心，沒有底線、不給創作者任何框架的創作空間，就算是被顏料畫得面目全非也盡力配合，求得只是一個創意的完整，這是身為一個主流歌手非常難能可貴的，你去看看那些主流的CD封面或MV就可充分瞭解這其中的突破了，華語歌手總是被要求臉要清楚、要大、要美、舞蹈要好記.....創意總是被放在很後面，而這MV最令人振奮的是，我們終於可以把創意放在第一位了!!!

198,217958236,Note to Self,"Unfinished business is the worst and a couple things have consistently hovered over my conscience over the past few years. The first being a bundle of beautiful footage sitting unused on a hard drive (from a scrapped music video o' mine) - the second being the way I ended a rather delightful little summer rendezvous. Both contain content recorded during completely different chapters (even cities) of my life yet for some reason, when I connected the two, all felt right in the world and I'd even argue it was almost as if they were waiting on the other to be a complete(d) piece. That piece is now viewable in the form of a short titled “Note to Self."" 

All I will say as a disclaimer is that what it lacks in length I hope it makes up for in honesty, heart and vulnerability as it’s filled from start to finish with a good deal of mine.",2017-05-18T03:19:20-04:00,362331573,120,217958236,45,185060,1188,https://i.vimeocdn.com/video/635306413_780x439.webp

221,203983112,Magnitude Rituals 지진영제(地震禜祭),"The earthquake of M5.8, the largest on the Korean Peninsula, occurred in Korea, which was called the ""Earthquake Safety Zone,"" in 2016. Gyeongju City suffered a great deal of damage due to the ineffectiveness of the Korean government and the insecurity of safety. By the year 2017, there have been about 500 aftershocks, and Koreans are living in fear of an earthquake that will happen anytime soon.

Magnitude Rituals is an image of praying that no earthquake will happen in Korea. The former Korean peninsula country, which was a farming country, had a ritual to pray for rain in the sky every drought season. In this regard, this work expresses a ritual to wish an earthquake not to happen. The image consists of two frames. The image on the left represents the progress of the ritual, and the image on the right represents the earthquake where its value of the graph representing the earthquake converges to zero and the process of the earthquake is reversed.

What I wanted to pursue in my work was the communication of messages using the contrast of Korean traditional and shamanic images and sophisticated mathematical graphics. On the surface, it appears to be unrelated images, but as the ritual process progresses, it expresses that the figure indicating the earthquake in the graph subsides, and the audience will be able to gradually understand and appreciate the images.

‘지진안전지대’라고 불리던 한국에 2016년 경주에서 한반도 최대 규모 M5.8의 지진이 발생하였다. 한국 정부의 미숙한 대처와 안전불감증의 분위기 속에 경주시는 큰 피해를 보았다. 2017년 현재까지 500여 차례의 여진이 발생하면서, 한국 국민은 언제 일어날지 모르는 지진을 두려워하며 살고 있다.

지진영제(地震禜祭)는 대한민국에서 더는 지진이 일어나지 않길 기원하는 제사를 그린 영상이다. 농본 국가였던 대한민국 이전 한반도 국가는 가뭄 시기마다 하늘에 비를 기원하는 제사를 지냈다. 이에 착안하여 이 작업은 지진이 일어나지 않기를 기원하는 제사를 표현하였다. 영상은 두 개의 프레임으로 구성된다. 왼쪽 영상은 제사의 진행 과정을 표현하고, 오른쪽 영상은 지진을 나타내는 그래프의 값이 0으로 수렴하는 모습과 지진이 발생하는 과정이 거꾸로 진행되는 모습을 표현했다. 

작업하면서 가장 추구하고 싶었던 것은 한국 전통과 무속 이미지와 정교한 수학적 그래픽 간의 대조 속에서의 메시지 전달이었다. 겉으로 보기에는 서로 간에 연관성이 없어 보이는 이미지이지만, 제사가 진행되면서 그래프 속의 지진을 나타내는 수치가 멎어 들고 있음을 표현하여 관객이 영상을 감상하면서 천천히 이해할 수 있기를 바랐다.

226,215510559,She's All That and the Power of Transformation,"She’s All That introduced American teenagers to high-stakes bets in their high school halls. If Freddie Prinze Jr. was gonna make the dorky Laney Boggs prom queen, he was gonna need to give her an extreme makeover because as it is, she’s ugly — she has glasses, a bad haircut and she doesn’t tweeze her eyebrows. This movie shows us her transformation in a highly entertaining 90 minutes. At first, audiences must sit there and think, “There’s no way,” but by the end you’re seeing she’s actually pretty hot and has a decent shot at beating Taylor Vaughn for prom queen. So sit back and relax and enjoy my video essay and make sure to watch till the end as I edit together a special “what if” ending. Also, be sure to go re-watch this iconic movie from 1999 that was made by Miramax Films.

228,214947122,LOVE,"We are excited to announce Jonathan Rentschler’s photobook “LOVE” now available to order through Paradigm Publishing and a short film to promote the book documenting the last days of LOVE Park and the destruction of the plaza.

About the book:

LOVE follows the last generation of LOVE Park inhabitants and reveals life as it was within this notorious urban plaza. The images, gathered over a three-year span, tell the story of a deeply rooted community shadowed by a police state and a biased city government.

Ultimately the victim of urban revitalization, the park closed in February 2016 for a $16 million complete renovation. But the diehard locals refused to leave, continuing to skate the plaza even as it turned to rubble. In the end, LOVE is a narrative about loss.

About LOVE Park:

LOVE Park (1965-2016), also known as John F. Kennedy Plaza, was located in the center of Philadelphia. Architect Vincent Kling drafted the mid-century urban design, which was then implemented by city planner Edmund Bacon. Although it was not designed for skateboarding, the plaza was host to a wave of skateboarders who first discovered its granite expanses as early as the 1980s. It was raised to global renown in the late ’90s with a surge of media coverage. Today, LOVE Park is remembered as one of the foremost landmarks of street skateboarding.

People should be happy. Even this Egyptian goose, who tries to cast a spell on us with a seductive dance. Its gracious and clumsy movements captivate us. But it’s not the only one to master the dance. Three flocks of geese each led by their guru goose also share the pond; all of them torn between their desire to express their own individuality and the urge for group behavior. Soon the water begins to rise. Never mind. The geese will keep on dancing for us until they drown.
A video about the search for ones own identity through seemingly audacious self-expression on the one hand and the undeniable drowning into the masses on the other.

Rotterdam based singer/songwriter Mark Lotterman found a very special way to release his 5th record, HOLLAND. He asked painters, filmmakers, writers, scientists, and photographers to contribute something to one of the songs from the album.

Animators Case Jernigan and Erik Winkowski trade short stories, stringing together a flurry of imagery and messages. The two artists craft animation from paper, stop-motion, and drawing. Music producer Josh Giunta (Love Science Music) paces through an array of musical colors with his rhythmic and lush sound design.

Synopsis: When I was leaving for college, my aunt Dana told me I had a cousin I’d never met who was matriculating in the same year as me. We shared classes and had friends in common but for some strange reason I never introduced myself. All during college, and then into the real world, through a decade of overlapping connections, we never met. This film is an examination of that hesitation and an attempt to understand why I never made the easiest connection in the world… until it was too late. Through archival footage and re-enactment of the era in question, IDAC is ultimately a documentary about what was happening on an unconscious level and how distant a relative can be even when they’re right in front of your face.

Production Notes: I've made over 100 short films, many of which examine issues of family, the blurry line between fiction and non-fiction and the sometimes disturbing, sometimes hilarious ways our memories fail us. IDAC is an autobiographical documentary which is a genre my movies (or at least parts of them) often fall into. The key with autobiography in my opinion is to avoid being sentimental at all costs. This does not mean you can’t be funny or can’t be authentic and personal – it’s just that it being your story does not automatically make it interesting. On top of that, IDAC also considers the way we dream and the way dreams can invade our everyday life – which is another subject matter that can easily steer a film awry. So making IDAC was exciting because once mindful of all these pitfalls, there was an enormous feeling of restraint that coursed through the documentary’s production. My hope is that people who see my film IDAC recognize familiar moments and feelings from their own lives: memories they can’t quite explain, people they think they know and dramatic, life-defining events that upon further scrutiny don’t exactly add up as neatly as they once thought.

Let's dive in and take a look at three different films all in different stages of the restoration process, plus take a look at how film restoration as a whole has evolved and continues to evolve in an increasingly digital world.

260,211452489,TENERIFE UNKNOWN,"In September we spent two weeks with five cameras and two sleeping bags in Tenerife to explore the island abroad from all the tourism hotspots, focussing on its nature and lost places.
In 10 days we slept several nights beneath one of the most breathtaking night skies there are in the whole world, visited ghost town, a forgotten village which used to be a leper colony until it was abandoned, and found a lost hotel, which's construction was suddenly stopped in the 70s because the owner was unknown.
We gathered 42.187 shots which kept us over 240 hours busy in post production and take up 1,12 Terra bytes of our hard drives.

First, the soundtrack was composed according along the theme ""Life"". Nobumichi Asai and Shingo Abe was inspired by the music and then made face mapping work. Aya Sato designed choreography. TOKYO completed the project by making the video work.

The music brought Asai the image of “the radioactive.” The destructive force of the radioactive could cause “death,” “suffering,” and “sorrow.” And “prayers” could overcome them. These subjects infuse AYABAMBI’s powerful performance. Their performance crushes and conquer black tears, skulls and the Heart Sutra. We built up the concept during the production and Abe designed animation for face mapping.

There was a big challenge in technical aspects. We realized the new mapping system that allows us to follow intense performances by using the latest 1,000 fps projector, DynaFlash(*1) and a super speed sensor. It is very new and it had not been done before. Projected images become part of their skin and they transform their faces.

At the beginning of our development, there was an issue, AYABAMBI would loose freedom of performances if we accelerated the tracking speed. Asai, Yoshimura (WOW), Lecturer Watanabe and Teshima (EXVISION) explored how we could keep the tracking speed securing the freedom of performances, taking three months of trial and error to reduce a few milliseconds. And we finally developed this system(*2).


*1 “DynaFlash” is developed jointly by Ishikawa Watanabe Laboratory, the University of Tokyo and is commercialized by Tokyo Electron Device Limited. 

*2 For tracking hands, we use the dynamic projection mapping technology developed by Ishikawa Watanabe Laboratory, the University of Tokyo. For tracking faces, we use the face mapping technology developed by the visual design studio, WOW inc.",2017-03-29T09:23:35-04:00,1510782804,71,210599507,73,477215,6741,https://i.vimeocdn.com/video/626430256_780x439.webp

270,207763253,The Birth Of A Dugout Canoe by Northmen,"This is a documentary movie uncovering the difficult and time consuming process of making traditional expanded dugout canoe using mostly traditional hand tools and techniques. 

The master woodworker in this movie is Richard (Rihards Vidzickis) - an experienced green wood worker, wood sculptor and dugout canoe maker. Richard’s passion to green wood and solid wood creations has grown together with him since his childhood days. Richard’s father is also a wood worker and carpenter and has led his son into the beautiful world of working with wood. Richard has gone through all the traditional steps of becoming a master woodworker - starting from an apprentice, then journeyman and then receiving his Master degree in Latvian chamber of crafts. Richard’s passion to wood is not only sculpturing and carving it but also knowing the wood in a scientific level. So Richard has studied in Technical university as a student and reached his degree of Doctor in engineering materials science, so he has combined the craft, nature and science in his life and work. While working in furniture making during the studies, with making different kinds of difficult wood carving for Jugend, Barrocal, Renesance design style furniture, Richard has discovered that he tends to get back to more rustic, robust and natural forms of wood, so he created a park of massive wooden sculptures, wood crafts museum and live workshop where Richard lives and creates wooden bowls, plates, boats and accepts visitors to share his work and lifestyle.

Over the past few years I've struggled to stay motivated around this time of the year. By March we've had nearly six months of cold and it's easy to fall into a slump. The weather recently has been the craziest I've ever seen it in New York City between the low fog, snowstorms, and erratic temperature changes. I wanted to make this video to reflect how I've been feeling lately and all I can say is that I can't wait for spring to finally roll in.",2017-03-06T20:42:25-05:00,76086570,60,207217234,34,133010,1570,https://i.vimeocdn.com/video/622233148_780x439.webp

-----
Μy last trip to Norway during February, 2017.
The Lofoten Archipelago is spread on the northwest side of Norway, very close to the borders of the Arctic Circle. It is a cluster of small fishing villages and is often called “the Foot of the lynx” because of its shape.
 The islands are full of legends, maybe because of their natural beauty and their mysterious landscapes, or maybe because there the Sun either never rises or never sets. The only thing you can hear is the thousand voices of birds, the wind and the sound of the sea. That combination of the landscape which comes into view every morning and the sounds of nature is a priceless experience that fills you with energy and inspiration for the whole day, no matter what you have to face.

301,205018000,1976,"1976 meditates on presentiment and sound. The surreal short crafts an unsettling atmosphere of foreshadowing and immanent change. A clever combination of live footage and CGI, the film allows its soundtrack to drive the visuals. Everyday objects reverberate, twist and react to an oncoming pulse of events as they converge on a farmhouse lost in rural America.

Since winning the German championship in 2003, he worked everyday on his inventive tricks while phoning with his wife wife Anna, on his wooden kitchen table.
Through this hard training his fingers became harder than any industry steal you can buy.
His Pro Model, with a a red Skwirral, (which is his favorite animal, right after turtles and foxes) crowns his legendary 21 years of Finger Skateboarding.

Titles like Citizen Kane, Blade Runner, Vertigo, It's a Wonderful Life, and more all share this in common. Let's talk about this concept of re-evaluation and what it means, if anything at all, for the future.

November saw the team gather for the first time deep in NW Ireland. For some this was the first meet, for others a welcome reunion of familiar faces. We walked far, ate well, surfed hard and lived for a while, sharing stories. Every one of us had been introduced to the sea by our parents, be they surfers, farmers, teachers or sailors. The conversation moved onto how it had shaped our lives, and shed light on what may lie in our futures. 

A lot went on in 2016 for the Finisterre Ambassadors. Fergal Smith stood as a candidate in last year’s Irish General Election and worked up on the Moy Hill Community Farm, showing us how to reconnect to the land. Noah Lane continued to push the boundaries of cold water surfing, winning the Wave of the Winter. Our team manager Matt Smith co-founded Backwash, a print anthology about surf and culture, as well as Hometree, an Irish re-forestation initiative. Easkey Britton finished her doctorate and founded Waves of Freedom. Sam Bleakley also finished his PhD, flying to all corners of the globe using surfing to affect change and deliver a positive social impact. Newcomer Sandy Kerr got engaged to his childhood sweetheart Rachel, bought a house and is spreading the word of surf and healthy living to younger generations in the North East. 

We left with a further shared sense of purpose and common ground, excited to see where our paths take us in 2017 and beyond.",2017-01-31T06:35:01-05:00,514080222,324,201834586,10,34773,575,https://i.vimeocdn.com/video/615703108_780x439.webp

Lest we forget about the marble plazas of Ashdod... magical. A few found their deepest, most spiritual selves in the ally's of Jerusalem's old city. Sprawling across the tomb of Jesus, only to be lost again the following day in the blazing banks of the Dead Sea and through the desert to Eilat.

The time has now come for his only son to be initiated into the grim and dangerous whaling life, and Silas must be the one to teach him.

Loud Places captures three iconic venues in their current state - venturing inside a restaurant, a gym and a vaudeville theatre to explore the addresses that were once home to live music.

Bringing together the performers, promoters and audience members that once made these places their sonic homes, we seek to reawaken the walls that once housed noise across London, Paris and Berlin.

328,196755403,SPLIT,"Throughout our lives, we often inspire undue stress and anxiety by viewing our existence with a “dualistic mind.” We create a world of private duality, a world that is limited to fixed or black and white thinking. We do this because it gives us a (false) sense of security and control over life’s uncertainties. The dualistic mind tricks us into thinking we have this “life” thing figured out, and we don’t have to struggle and search anymore.

329,200671449,SEASONS of NORWAY - A Time-Lapse Adventure,"With its imposing mountains, endless plateaus and echoing valleys, Norway is a country where nature takes the lead. Using time-lapse, this film attempts to capture the ebb and flow of the seasons and is a result of one year of planning, a second year of shooting and four months of editing.
 
20,000 kilometers have been travelled, 200,000 photos taken and 20 terabytes worth of hard drives filled. Months have been spent hiking through the mountains, sleeping in tents and travelling through the entire country hunting for the best locations.
 
SEASONS of NORWAY is shot and edited by Morten Rustad. The video is available in up to 8K resolution (7680*4320 letterboxed).

331,198306286,GLACIER EXIT,"We stood on the ice dunes of the glaciers of Alaska in the midst of a snowy winter. Trekking the slopes of another planet had been on our list for a long time. The silence and majesty of the mountains surrounding us, the bluest ice we had ever seen and the steady rush of ice turned to water. How did we get here? We met Rick by chance on a rainy road in Seward, Alaska. He had a worn work jacket, a great white beard and the friendliest demeanor two travelers could ask for. He turned out to be the skeleton key to the locked treasure that was our way into Exit Glacier. We had the entire ice field to ourselves. And a sole chance to tell its story. So we took it.

This was an experimental film put together simply as an opportunity to have a play in-between projects. After much deliberation we set ourselves a brief to create a collection of scenarios subverting the physical properties of...anything. It made for some interesting comments along the way. “That egg’s not bouncy enough, the cloth coming out of the tap needs to feel more like water, the bowling ball needs to feel heavier as it floats off…”. We suddenly realised we were playing our own client (hence the in-joke above) This is FauxPhysics_09_FINAL_V16_ForApproval_FINAL_withAudio_FINAL_1.mov ;·)

We've started lots of these projects over the years. This rare creature is one that's finally found its way out of the studio. And no, it wasn’t at all annoying to see this peach https://vimeo.com/191444383 appear on Vimeo half way through the process. ◔_◔

To find out more about the project check out this interview on Directors Notes with Director Ben http://directorsnotes.com/2017/01/20/ben-cox-creatures-of-the-deep/ 

Alan’s creative practice began in his childhood, creating fantastical hybrid creatures using old toys and a tube of glue. Currently entering his 14thth year of practice, Alan’s passion is making animals and creatures from mostly found and recycled metal; transforming recognisable every day objects into beautifully detailed, sculptural artworks. His unique hand crafted works imaginatively reference nature; animals, plants, textures, form and movement. Commissions include sculpture, architectural installations, furniture and many of his public artworks are on display in locations throughout Sussex and the UK.

Ben Cox - Director
""This film is the result of the wanting to create a passion project based around a local Brighton artist. The resulting film has surpassed all my original expectations both in the final product and the experience I had in making it. Working with Alan over the 6 months has been a wonderful experience and I have been exposed to an artist of great talent, imagination and humility. The project has been a wonderful collaboration, with Alan putting a lot of trust and faith in me as a filmmaker and I enjoyed every second of it"".",2017-01-08T08:54:56-05:00,1569389053,423,199060571,42,105691,1679,https://i.vimeocdn.com/video/612214160_780x439.webp

If scenes are just written and then animated, is their role any more than just connecting clips together? On the contrary, the role of an animation editor is actually one of the most important roles in shaping the film being made. Let's dive in and explore the job.

354,197324296,Art is Theft,"Art is Theft is a personal project I've been planning for a long time.

Creation is not inspired by one man, woman or one thing. We are influenced by our daily fair, diverse artists etc. I have admired various influential artists in my life, such as Picasso, Dali and Warhol. With this film, I attempted to convey an approach to the creative process and express how all artists, at any level, ""steal"" the art and the very soul of other artists, while forming their ""original"" pieces. 

The one and only Ambrose Yu did a wonderful work in the sound design of this piece. I strongly recommend listening to this film while wearing headphones. Thank you.

About -

I wanted to show how skateboarding is a universal language. No matter where you're from or where you live, it unites us all.
 
Found in the Kintale slums, Kampala, the park acts as a refuge an escape for local kids. Growing up in these tough conditions a lot of them can easily turn to crime. Skateboarding and the park (Run by the Uganda Skateboard Union) act as an outlet to combat this, a focus if you like. We found Trinity, our protagonist, hanging around the park; he was the only one out of the group of boys sat there who didn't smile. Something very serious and melancholic about him - a story behind those eyes. But then when he did smile, wow, our hearts melted. He's a little star, to say the least.
 
The shoot was an emotional, harrowing and humbling experience that opened mine and the crew’s eyes. I love the fact that, by making this, we've been able to contribute to the building of the second part of the park.",2016-11-29T06:11:23-05:00,253108693,263,195433452,106,784853,4995,https://i.vimeocdn.com/video/607688565_780x439.webp

373,189050258,GLOBE OF DEATH,"‘Globe of Death’ is the story of Lucius Zafalon, a daredevil motorcycle rider that risks his body in the pursuit of the perfect globe of death act. Through all the challenges and difficulties he has never stopped focusing on his art. It is what defines him and what he has lived his whole life for.

An act of raw beauty with precise flowing lines that defy the laws of physics, they create an awe inspiring ballet that mesmerises anyone who dares to keep their eyes open.

For Lucius and his team The Globe of Death is not just an act, it is their lives.

The Globe of Death is a stunt that dates from the beginning of the 20th century. One of the oldest patents for the mesh sphere ball was filed in 1904.

Different to the Wall of death (popular in the UK) where the riders ride only on the horizontal, with the Globe of Death multiple riders can race in any direction at the same time.

The Globe of Death gained popularity in Latin America and some of the best acts comes from Brazil. What makes a good Globe of Death act isn’t just how many motorcycles the team can fit inside the Globe, but also the beauty of their riding lines. The synchrony between the riders and the team’s particularities, such as riding in the dark and opening the Globe in half sets Lucius’ team apart.

Directed by Pedro and James (Autobahn), they met Lucius through their passion for motorcycles. ‘We were mesmerised by how incredibly visual the act is and thought that combined with his life story it was a perfect subject for a film’.

With photography by DP Malte Rosenfeld, colour grading by Jim Bracher at The Mill, and sound design by Patch Rowland at Final Cut, the film is a look into Lucius’ life and all he has gone through during 30 years of riding motorcycles in the Globe of Death.

O’Neill is proud to present Bezerke, a captivating short film that looks into the life of O’Neill team rider, Russell Bierke.

Russell isn’t your average eighteen-year-old Australian kid. He is leading the way for the next generation of big wave surfers. Tracing his love of heavy waves from childhood to the present day, Bezerke showcases the surfing of a levelheaded young man that sees challenge where most only see terror. 

Bezerke features insight from Russell’s father, and also includes scenes from eleven-time world champion Kelly Slater who shared a special session in Southern Australia with Russell when he was fifteen.  Bezerke documents Russell’s phenomenal Cape Fear event win and his thoughts on the future of big wave surfing.",2016-11-29T15:25:12-05:00,1858625189,915,189050258,19,41811,909,https://i.vimeocdn.com/video/647622625_780x439.webp

Islet are a four piece collaborative band from Wales. The band has no lead singer or set roles, switching instruments from song to song. Pitchfork described their sound as “unhinged, euphoric, wonderful” and NME as a “model of how a left-leaning rock band ought to conduct themselves”.

They formed in Cardiff in 2009 where they quickly made a name for themselves through high energy live performances played with joyful abandon, most gigs seeing the walls and audience played as instruments. They have since released 2 LPs and a handful of EPs on their own Shape Records.

389,192438480,WITNESS,"An ode to letting in the fears of heartbreak and failure and riding on the crest of those feelings. 
“Turn those broken dreams, into rainbows of lazer beams…and keep dancing""

After Paskalev is confronted by “Death”, a young, inoffensive man with his customary questionnaire on life and regrets, Paskalev is granted one final wish; to express himself through dance. The scene unfolds in a cheaply converted old swimming pool, as Mik plays out his routine under the gaze and judgement of Death. “A Witness in the Shadow of Love”. The dance slowly inspires a yearning and rapport between both characters as they come together for the last throes of the video. Bringing home the final release and optional metaphors.

But when strange things start happening in the old house, and the the realms of the living and the dead become intertwined, she will have to realize that there’s no escaping one’s past.

416,187462742,Shanghai Forever,"'Urbanologist' and media artist JT Singh has captured the vibrance and massive scale of Shanghai’s skyline, streets, and infrastructure through a series of experimental projects viewed by millions (This is Shanghai, Walk in Shanghai, etc); hence, contributing greatly to the city's growing global status.  With this new film, he turns to the Shanghai of its residents, the lives that revolve not around the city’s 4000 skyscrapers, but around the simpler ways of living, the local charm, and the familiar corner.

Amid the chaos of millions of people living and working with one another, the rich textures and smells, the voices and faces young and old, and the signs of tradition and change dwell behind each door and around each corner. With JT's riveting visual storytelling, viewers experience a series of impressions around historic shikkumen neighbourhoods, which foster a network of real-life experiences, memories, and encounters with locals, which are the tender heart keeping the city alive and charming to live in. Shanghai’s iconic skyline is symbolic of its presence as a premier global city, but below the towers, the intimate, and human story that unfolds is what will always be part of the city’s core DNA.

Forward by Lane Rick, an architect based in NYC

About JT Singh
JT Singh is an interdisciplinary media artist, urban futurist and world explorer, specializing in city-scale, global projects that blur the lines between technology, urbanism and narratives. It springs from his lifelong adventures and interest in socio-economic and environmental problems within cities that have led him to explore hundreds of urban areas worldwide through walking, walking and more walking, with eyes wide open.

His work is constantly featured in countless major publications, including Time, National Geographic, BBC, Washington Post, CNN, Vice, Guardian, China Daily, Quartz, Telegraph, Mashable and many of others.

The Project ""LUCID""

The idea was to create a surreal world based on simple geometric light shapes that seem misplaced, but somehow blend with its surrounding at the same time. Shapes that emphasize the mood of its surrounding in the most simple way. By installing electroluminescent light shapes and wires in untouched landscapes, a single lightsource tells a surreal story of magic and loneliness in a surreal and intense way. Every environment has its own light installation.
The intention was to summarize all installations in a cinematographic way to create a touching short film.

About Rode Gordijnen (Red Curtains)
'Rode Gordijnen' is a film about a man who tries to breathe new life into his out of touch relationship with his wife. Both characters seem to have reconciled themselves to their extinguished marriage: they have simply stopped communicating. But along the way their attitude towards each other, and towards their surroundings, changes substantially. One thing however remains the same: they still don’t talk.


ABOUT US
Rode Gordijnen (Red Curtains) is a short film by two enthusiastic initiators: director and producer Richard Valk and cameraman Feek Zonderland. This project is realised with the support of the experienced film producer Margot Nicolaes. 

In 1992 Richard started his company Valk producties. Initially as director but later also as a producer. He started out with television programmes as Lolapaloeza, Jules Unlimited, 2 Meter Sessions and various short and longer fiction films and documentaries. He is now director and producer of fiction, nonfiction, animation and music production.
In 2010 Freek started his film production company FreekFilms, and he is attracting much attention ever since. He operates in very different fields, and works, among other things, for the VPRO, a Dutch national station. Shooting fiction is his real passion.
Richard and Freek worked together on a film already once before. This collaboration worked out so well that they decided to gather together the same enthusiastic crew in order to make the short film Rode Gordijnen (Red Curtains)",2015-04-29T08:57:06-04:00,1813936606,920,185711393,47,264664,3320,https://i.vimeocdn.com/video/595552632_780x439.webp

These underground prank calls gained infamy, and became known as Park Grubbs, garnering such fans as The Flaming Lips, Daniel Clowes (Ghostworld, Art School Confidential), and Peter Bagge (Hate). Directed by two Okie filmmakers, Bradley Beesley and Ben Steinbauer, and featuring interviews with both the pranksters and the pranked, the legendary Park Grubbs prank calls come to life in this one-of a-kind documentary.

He hears the crowds. He tastes the sweat. He feels the energy. He smells the smoke. Most importantly, though, he sees himself bringing home a gold medal for Team USA at the 2016 Olympic Games.

And yet, after suffering a debilitating injury in 2010, this once-decorated athlete's goal seems more distant than ever. To reclaim his dream, he's dedicated his life to the power of positive thinking and visualization. As the games near and his odds converge with his aspirations, Charles explores past wounds both on and off the track and realizes that true victory doesn’t always come in gold.

**LYRICS**
We were layin’ on a hill and the sun was going down 
Wayne was pointing out the itsy caterpillars on the ground 
And he gently kissed me on the cheek and said he had to go 
‘Cause there were eco-friendly fields of kale he needed to help grow 
Next to saving the less fortunate, I guess I lost my charm 
WOOFER Wayne picked up and flew away to irrigate a farm 
He dug my heart out with a spade and then he dragged me through the dirt 
Well, I hope he's reached enlightenment in his designer yurt 
I’ll read your gap year blog, follow all the things you do 
Saw that you spent seven thousands bucks on farming in Peru 
I think you look real swell in that woven tribal wear 
And your buzzcut really suits you, you looked bougie with long hair 
Then bongo drumming David came a’ knockin’ on my soul 
He kept maracas in his pockets and was bored by rock and roll 
He percussed me off my feet and he sent shivers down my spine 
I tried to keep up with his beat, but I never could keep time 
And my lack of rhythmic inclinations sent him far away 
He went off to drum in Kenya, left his Beats by Dr. Dre 
Told me he's released his spirit, and the wind's his soundtrack now 
Hope his remix of nature's tricks is posted on Soundcloud 
I thought we'd never be over 
Thought that one of these boys would become a nice Vice vlogger 
And enroll at Wesleyan, or maybe Sarah Lawrence 
Not leave to find themselves in the goddamn forest",2016-09-07T16:47:57-04:00,575002879,232,176486858,42,174254,3300,https://i.vimeocdn.com/video/583743781_780x439.webp

500,178352983,ALL DAY ALL NIGHT,"“All Day All Night” is a short documentary featuring legendary rapper Del the Funky Homosapien (Gorillaz, Deltron 3030, Hieroglyphics). We met in São Paulo in a skateboarding session where he talked about his struggle to improve his flatground ollie and music. 

The film builds a parallel between his thoughts and the chaotic urban aesthetic of São Paulo.

Those images came from the b-rolls of the upcoming documentary “Concrete Poetry” that narrates the birth of São Paulo underground hip-hop movement set to be realised in 2017.

The subject I chose, over thinking, is something most people deal with at some degree.
We tend to twist thoughts around our head until they lose any connection with reality, 
making billions of connections every minute and soaking up information like sponges.
I wanted to share what is going on inside my head by creating a world,
that like my thoughts - is sometimes restless and makes no sense.

Edit: Edwin de Swardt - (www.swardt.com)

I started working on this film just over 4 months ago, at night and in the early mornings before work. 
(It’s purely a personal artistic project, not commissioned by the record label).

I got permission to use the music from Benjamin Stefanski (Raffertie).
“Last train home” on his SLEEP OF REASON album just kept coming back as the perfect fit. 
He was also constantly involved with the process and gave feedback throughout which was great. Thanks Ben!

The edit was done by my friend Edwin. He also worked after hours and sacrificed his free time on this. I think he did amazing work for which I'm incredibly thankful!

I will post some behind the scenes stuff on Patreon.com/gerhardhuman in due time :)",2016-07-26T11:37:51-04:00,437808101,239,176703851,102,228279,6089,https://i.vimeocdn.com/video/584012192_780x439.webp
519,176508773,Madam President,"As the very first female presidential nominee of a major party, Democrat Hillary Clinton is already in a historic position. Come November, she could achieve another milestone: becoming the first Madam President in United States history. Yet behind the groundbreaking nature of Clinton’s candidacy lies an absence of women in elected office; in terms of female representation at the national level, the U.S. lags behind much of the rest of the world.

Created in collaboration between FiveThirtyEight and Rutgers University’s Center for American Women and Politics (CAWP), the video here is an exploration of this disparity and the real difference that gender, regardless of party, can make.

Of course, what you see would not have been possible without the talents of FiveThirtyEight's Art Director, Kate LaRue, the art and animation skills of Tom McCarten, music + sound design from Redhorse Studio, and data viz guidance from Ella Koeze. Additional thanks goes out to Debbie Walsh at CAWP and Barbara Burrell, both of whom were extremely generous with their time and research.

527,174313049,The Search for Earth Proxima,"Since astronomers first discovered exoplanets in 1995, we've come to learn that there are a staggering amount of planets out there in the universe. But, we have yet to find one that's habitable, aside from our own. The Search for Earth Proxima is a short documentary about a group of scientists and their mission to build a telescope to hunt for an Earth-like planet around our closest neighbor: Alpha Centauri.

540,173280276,Rose is the Apple of My Eye,"ROSE IS THE APPLE OF MY EYE

The magic of skateboarding isn’t going further or faster or even higher. Those are physical feats that the mind automatically gravitates towards, when learning a new skill. Fluidity is skateboarding’s power and allure—the ability to physically interact with your environment in completely new ways and adapt to anything. Every time you step on a skateboard, no matter what your age, race, sex, or even physical capabilities are, you have a unique opportunity to do something that’s never been done before.
 
If you embrace that side of skateboarding, New York City is one of the most expansive palettes to create on, despite Manhattan being less than 23 square miles. For Aaron Herrington, it wasn’t his home state of Oregon or California—skateboarding’s de facto capital—where he became a professional skateboarder, but it was in the Five Boroughs of New York, where he found himself, while nursing a serious injury. That unspoken power, hidden on every block how NYC became the apple of his eye.
 
At only 26-years-old, Herrington’s body of work has already proved that you don’t have to be from the East Coast to be an East Coast Skateboarder, just as you don’t have to be born in NYC, to be a New Yorker. And most importantly, in a city that’s constantly changing, there are infinite opportunities to do something new, every time you leave your doorstep.
 
If you’d seen his Static IV part or his skating in Pontus Alv’s most recent skate film, I like it here inside my mind, please don’t wake me this time., you’ll immediately understand Herrington’s skateboarding. It taps into the spontaneous freedom that’s made Video Days such a beloved moment in skateboarding, as much as it's a continuation of the street discipline, captured by Dan Wolfe in Eastern Exposure 3: Underachievers. It’s anywhere, anytime, anyhow, and once you embrace that ever-evolving mindset, you can adapt that credo wherever skateboarding takes you. For Herrington, 2015 took him across the world, for the Converse CONS “One Star World Tour,” but it’s the way he taps into New York City’s energy that best displays his power, finesse, and boundless energy. If you’re steeped in East Coast skateboarding, you want to see Ricky Oyola crush the streets of Philadelphia, Bobby Worrest expanding on the history of marble and granite Pulaski in DC, Freddy Gall ripping crusty spots in New Jersey, and Herrington is an extension of that family tree, most firmly rooted in New York.
 
For some skaters, it takes a while to form who they are. Years are spent building up a foundation, before their personality truly shines through. Limbs need to fully extend, muscles need to rip and reform stronger, and an eye for spots needs to be gained. In many ways, Herrington’s skateboarding is freakishly mature, without attempting to be so. There’s a natural flow to his skating, that, like his personality is never forced. There’s no pretension, just the pure love of riding a skateboard and sharing that commonality with anyone down for the cause. And yes, part of that cause is donuts, because, again, shit just isn’t that serious and it shouldn’t be.
 
Herrington, along with an entire generation of skateboarders, is part of a shift in the documentation of skating, where every one with a board and a camera can shape what’s seen on their social media accounts. For decades, even the most photographed pros were only depicted in what? 20… 25 photographs a year? That’s a sliver of coverage compared to the real time, always on documentation of today. Part of the soul of “Rose Is the Apple of My Eye,” is stepping back into the essence and preciousness of a filmer and skater, working to create a body of work together—one of purpose and intent, standing as art, not content in the digital world.
 
This is Aaron Herrington framed through photographer Pep Kim’s eye. Like Herrington, Kim’s not from New York, but something about East Coast skateboarding—the mindset, the lifestyle, the weather, and the purity—infected him six years ago, since leaving his home in Korea. It’s more than photographing a trick, it’s the relationship between the skater, the obstacle, and the one documenting it, which becomes a symbiotic trinity—all parts equal, creating the whole. This is how I want to see skateboarding and this is how i want to see New York, cracks, scars, flaws, and all, because those imperfections equal a perfection that’s best captured and appreciated, rather than explained.

This is my last film at CalArts!
Growing up with an older sister with pretty severe OCD, I faced difficulties when it came to hanging out with friends, and focusing on my dreams. My whole family was influenced by her illness and it was something that was very hard to discuss about. I always had mixed feelings about my sister because I understood that she was also struggling with her problems, but at the same time I just felt so unfair how everything had to revolve around her.

It's a story I always wanted to tell. I had a good experience making it!

559,171247523,My Brother,"“My Brother” is a personal tribute to the silent contributions of migrant workers globally. I grew up in the island city-state of Singapore, where encounters with migrants of countries as diverse as Bangladesh, Myanmar, China and the Philippines are part of everyday living. Many of them take on jobs that are considered by the larger public to be menial in nature. Sometimes, the differences in our cultures and socioeconomic statuses cause social friction. When we allow this to be left unchecked, it can evolve into darker displays of xenophobic behavior.

But the inability to see past differences is not just a local issue; it is an increasingly global one. From where I am now in the United States, I am beginning to see how irresponsible political rhetoric, among other factors, influences previously big-hearted populations, populations which embraced – indeed championed – diversity. 
My response to this wave of sentiments is inspired by a quote I came across recently, attributed to the French composer Claude Debussy: music is the silence between the notes. The project aims to recognize the silent migrant workers’ contributions to our communities and celebrate their music between our notes.

“My Brother” is thus a metaphor for the thousands of underappreciated migrant workers we come across during our daily commute. I believe that bridges are built on bricks of commonalities and so the focus of this project is on the spaces of our shared humanity – school, families and personal dreams. 

After viewing the video, it is my personal hope that you make my brother, your brother too.

563,97900175,70 Hester Street,"A film about my childhood home, all childhood homes and the past lives of old buildings.

I grew up on the Lower East Side of Manhattan in a building that was once a synagogue, a whiskey still, a raincoat factory and when I was born there, a studio for my artist parents. They moved in after they got married in 1967 and rented the top two floors for 45 years from another family. In 2012, the 130-year-old building was sold by that family and my parents moved out. But before they did, I filmed the hell out of it. And I realized I shared history with countless people who had lived or worked in this old building over two centuries. I filmed the neighborhood I grew up in and saw how rare old buildings with shared histories were becoming. 

My film is about my childhood home and how much of the past you could still see in it when we left. It’s about the development of a neighborhood a lot of lives have passed through and whether you can protect that legacy while still making room for new lives and new memories. In making my movie, I tried to follow some advice my mom gave me: “Don’t make a movie about moving out. Make it about how great it was to live here.” I like that sentiment but I couldn’t help wondering what was going to happen next to the old building I grew up in. - Casimir Nozkowski

569,170793958,Gentle Angry People,"From the floral-covered steps of City Hall to the sweat-drenched dancefloor of Precinct DTLA, we Angelenos stood together (over 2,000 in fact) to honor the members of our fellow LGBTQIA family in Orlando whose lives were cut senselessly short over the weekend. 

The range of mourning (some choosing silence, others spoken word and a few using dance) from all walks of life wholeheartedly touched me. In fact, the bittersweet beauty of it all riveted me so much I decided to share some of my experience via video. 

And while we have made our visibility known in numbers as we mourn, let's make sure to keep that momentum as we act (in honor of those who are no longer able to fight). Get involved via everytown.org/act. ‪#‎DisarmHate‬

590,167667154,can i come over?,"A commentary on modern romance and the dynamics of having casual sex with someone you don’t love - focusing on the feeling of not being able to voice specific desires because of the lack of intimacy since the ultimate goal of the relationship is sex, not emotional support or any sort of connection. The refrainment from asking for more because of the fear of coming off as too attached, and creating a relationship that is more than what was unspokenly “agreed” upon

 …But still having the desire to have affection and attention that is not limited to just sexual stimulation, and craving a connection that is not as emotionally removed as sex is in this context, while trying to not let any emotional investment be involved.

598,167054481,When We Were Knights,"How can you express everything that you want to somebody you love, knowing that if you don't, that might be the last opportunity that you have? That is a reality that we all face, but for BASE jumpers, the risk of death sometimes results in something amazing and unexpected - love. 

This is the real story of a pure love between two friends in the face of risk and tragedy. 
 
Although we don’t normally publish content that is not shot 100% GoPro, Camp4 Collective Director, Anson Fogel, reached out to us to let us know that he simply could not have created this piece had it not been for the archival GoPro footage that was captured over the years. We are proud to share his beautiful story here.

Visualizing the invisible is always fascinating, and motion visualizations have been created even in pre-digital times with light, photography, costumes or paintings. I have described some of the methods that I applied in this work in my book ""Grids for the Dynamic Images"", published 2003.

The work was commissioned for a Kung Fu exhibition in Hong Kong. Kung Fu Masters: Lee Shek Lin, Wong Yiu Kau.

626,163349920,David Carson - All For a Few Good Waves,"David Carson is arguably the world’s most well known graphic designer. All For a Few Good Waves is a short documentary portrait offering a raw glimpse into the life and work of David, an uncompromising genius, who refuses to be anyone but himself.

After a career as a top ranked pro surfer and high school sociology teacher, he rose to prominence in the 90’s after art directing Transworld, Beach Culture and Ray Gun Magazines before going on to start his studio. With no formal design training, Carson took the design world by storm, upending conventions and breaking traditional rules he didn’t even know existed.

632,110821933,Rest Stop,"REST STOP follows Meredith, a young backpacker desperate to find meaning in her life, when she meets a mysterious stranger in a dingy British service station...claiming to know her. 

DIRECTOR: Kate Herron 
WRITERS: Kate Herron & Monica Heisey
CAST: Cari Leslie (Boom Chicago) & Ben Willbond (Horrible Histories). 

Rest Stop was a collaboration between British filmmaker Kate Herron and Canadian comedian/writer Monica Heisey. They were mentored on the project by Sky Comedy who described them as “A huge comedy voice in the years to come” and it was nominated for the Oscar-qualifying prize of Best Short at Flickers: Rhode Island Film Festival, taking home the Grand Prize for Best Comedy. 

When they can get Skype to work Kate and Monica are currently adapting Rest Stop into a web series where Meredith goes travels to England to meet her online British boyfriend but does not meet who she expects.

About the filmmakers:

Kate just finished directing drama mini-series “Five by Five” for the BBC starring and executive produced by Idris Elba. She also just finished a new short called “Smear” exploring smear test anxiety about a woman with a monster in her vagina. She was featured on this years Forbes 30 under 30. 

Monica’s written work has appeared in the New Yorker, Huffington Post and Playboy. She is  currently a writer on Schitt’s Creek starring Eugene Levy and Catherine O’Hara and also on the award-winning Canadian sketch comedy The Baroness Von Sketch Show. Her debut novel “I Can’t Believe It’s Not Better” was recommended by both the New Yorker and Lena Dunham.  

""Writers Kate Herron and Monica Heisey delight in the contrast between their chirpy but gauche backpacker and the mundane snooze-fest of the dimly lit rest-stop. A sharply written comedy two-hander."" - What to see at London Short Film Festival, British Film Institute Blog.",2014-11-03T15:41:01-05:00,413641022,658,162806244,19,329198,1785,https://i.vimeocdn.com/video/565877746_780x439.webp
633,161757232,The Story of Zero - Getting Something from Nothing,"What is zero? How did it come about? Hannah Fry tells the story of how zero went from nothing to something.

Once upon a time, zero wasn’t really a number. Its journey to the fully fledged number we know and love today was a meandering one. Today, zero is both a placeholder, and tool, within our number system signifying an absence of a value, and as a number in its own right. 

But it wasn’t always seen as that, and it still doesn’t act quite like other numbers. Can you divide by zero, for example?  Hannah Fry explains how zero came about, from its origins in ancient civilisations, through the resistance it faced from the Roman numeral system, to being the cornerstone of calculus.

Probing the illusive boundary itself, Interstice presents the veil as a self-contained magic trick: a shapeshifting second skin loaded with potential energy to manipulate identities and temporal-spatial dimensions that would otherwise be rendered immeasurable in its absence.  Interstice is an attempt to pass through the veil that obscures our collective vision to reach a space in-between.  An interstitial space.

648,159821179,Igneous Skis,"In 1996, Mike Parris worked as a robotics engineer at Carnegie Mellon. While he developed technology used on the Mars rover expeditions, his friends began building custom skis that would allow them to ride the terrain Jackson Hole had to offer. Mike pitched in with his mechanical expertise now and then to help design the equipment and process, ultimately leaving behind his career in robotics to create handcrafted skis that would forever leave a mark on the ski industry.

Igneous Skis was founded by Mike's friend, Adam Sherman, and is now operated by Mike Parris in Jackson, WY where he customizes only 100 pairs of skis each season, carefully tailoring each pair entirely by hand.

NeverGroomed.com offers skiers an elite collection of handmade skis designed to perform in the wildest mountains and most demanding conditions. By embracing the labor-intensive craftsmanship of smaller, independent brands, NeverGroomed is making fresh tracks in an industry dominated by mass-produced skis.

650,155214754,Sins,"“Everything at some point has been declared the root of all evil.”
― Criss Jami, Killosophy

Though the sins have fluctuated over time, the currently recognized list includes 
pride, greed, lust, envy, gluttony, wrath and sloth. There is a parallel tradition of seven virtues. 
The seven deadly sins are called ""capital"" because they are the origins of other vices.
This is my visual poem.

Like them on Facebook https://www.facebook.com/gamblersgamblersgamblers/?fref=ts&__mref=message

Gamblers is a New York City based band that draws on the eclectic musical backgrounds of its members to put a unique spin on rock-solid rock and roll fundamentals. Michael McManus, a hip-hop producer who has collaborated with Heems (formerly of Das Racist) and Rapsody, featured on Kendrick Lamar's ""To Pimp A Butterfly"" among others, formed the band with Gary O’Keefe, who has extensive experience as an audio engineer, and the other members (Johnny Hoblin, Joe Sanders, Peter DeMaio, and Boris Palacios) collectively boast dozens of former bands and music degrees. Combining catchy melodies with darker lyrical content that addresses themes such as alienation and addiction, the band uses a fishhook-in-a-cupcake approach that rewards close bedroom-headphone listening, while still providing a raucous live show. With the release of the single and video for the song ""We're Bound to Be Together,"" the band announces their arrival on the scene, and begins to build momentum towards their debut album ""Small World,"" coming later this year.

ABOUT THE FILM
Temple is a concept for a feature film, produced by the same team that made The Akira Project (www.akira-project.com), a crowd-sourced, live-action trailer based on the manga AKIRA, released in May 2014. It garnered over 3.5 million views online and received wide media coverage by Wired, The Creators Project, /Film, Mashable, amongst many others. The director, Nguyen-Anh Nguyen, is developing TEMPLE as his first long form project, basing himself on everything he loves; dystopian sci-fi, cyborgs and martial arts with a touch of manga thrown in for good measure. Supported again by a talented global production crew, we recently shot a short film in early 2015 which we are developing into a full length feature.

""It is sometimes an appropriate response to reality to go insane."" - PHILIP K. DICK

Synopsis
In the vertical skeleton of an aborted and abandoned megalopolis, a man stands on the edge of the void. The only escape from this forsaken place is through the depths of the unknown...

Idea
The main motivation behind this short film is to create a movie that has a strong visual narrative and yet leave the audience free to understand it in their own way.
More than free interpretation, the film balances itself between multiple meanings and ideas and ultimately forces the viewers to make their own choices. This involvement, this tipping of the balance engages the spectators and from the scope of themes addressed in the film let them shape the story in their personal way.

After many months of hard work, we are very happy to share this film with you.

689,156327049,1976,"1976 meditates on presentiment and sound. The surreal short crafts an unsettling atmosphere of foreshadowing and immanent change. A clever combination of live footage and CGI, the film allows its soundtrack to drive the visuals. Everyday objects reverberate, twist and react to an oncoming pulse of events as they converge on a farmhouse lost in rural America.

Troye Sivan - Papercut (Grey remix),"When the guys at Interscope and Blood Company approached us about doing a music video for Zedd’s Paper Cut, we knew it would be the perfect opportunity to try out an idea we had been toying with for a while: gathering a dream team of some of our favourite artists from around the world to create one cohesive film using a variety of styles.

After coming up with the storyline we put together a script, storyboard and animatic and then divided the shots between ourselves and 10 of our favourite collaborators, with the only guideline being to work in black and white with a hand drawn feel.

703,153737805,ANONYMOUS ZONE,"Well, we did it again. We made it to a new country to skateboard and we made a film about it. This time in Japan, and with great guides Rip Zinger and Arto Saari and skaters Ishod Wair, Peter Ramondetta, Raven Tershy and Kevin Terpening, we think it came out pretty rad. We dodged relentless security guards, got very lost in translation, went to three different cities on bullet trains and in vans and ripped across all the country, in all kinds of terrain and we made this: Anonymous Zone, a new clip directed by Kai Neville.

704,155246808,"CONNECTED - short film with Pamela Anderson, Dree Hemingway & Jane Fonda","Connected is a portrait of a woman grappling with aging, self-perception, and transformation in a technologically optimized world. Jackie (Pamela Anderson) is a burnt-out AuraCycle instructor in the midst of a midlife crisis. She's obsessed with self-improvement podcasts (voiced by Jane Fonda), and she is soon drawn to an advanced yet enigmatic wellness spa that promises to enhance her mind, body and soul. Guided by her effortless and nubile mentor, Luna (Dree Hemingway), Jackie will give up anything to feel “connected"" -- to herself, to the future, and to a precarious sense of perfection.

Director's Statement: 

Connected began when I met Pamela Anderson for the first time. After having explored issues of body modification and transformation in some of my photography and film projects, I was ready to create a narrative film which investigated these topics in a deeper, more grounded way. I knew that I wanted the project to surround an iconic sex symbol in the tradition of Marilyn Monroe and Bridgette Bardot. I'm fascinated by the level of mystery and mythology that surrounds these women. Their allure rests mainly on the surface, and that leaves me to wonder what lies beneath. 

Pamela Anderson is the sex symbol of my generation. Even before adolescence I remember posters of her plastered on bedroom walls. Men and women alike can instantly recall the visual of her running down the beach in a red bathing suit, and she’s still one of the most iconic emblems of America around the world. During my first meeting with Pamela, I was surprised to discover how thoughtful and open she is about her life and legacy. What is the evolution of a performer who has made her mark on the world with her body, something that inevitably depreciates with age? I explained that I wanted to ask these questions in the film, and to bring forth a vulnerable performance that blurs the lines between reality and fiction. Instead of focusing on the obvious relationship to sex, I wanted to focus on introspection and transformation. To some degree, we all are trading on idealized versions of ourselves. This has never been more clear with the advent of social media, where our public identities are entirely self-constructed and instantly surveyed, ranked, immortalized or trolled. 

For me Pamela is also an archetype of California culture, which is at once obsessed with the shallowness of youth and beauty, as well as the more existential search for self-help, wellness, and rehabilitation. Both of these polarities lead to a certain kind of alienation that I wanted to explore: the alienation and emptiness of beauty and objectification of oneself, and the alienation of continuously searching for something deeper and more authentic. I don't think it’s a coincidence that these two seemingly opposed obsessions coexist in places like Malibu. I believe, in fact, that they’re related to a singular kind of searching, which I wanted viewers to palpably feel and empathize with when watching the film. Intimacy and finding strength in being vulnerable is a big part of Pamela’s public story, as well as the community-driven, wellness culture element of Connected. 

Working with Pamela has been an incredible journey. She truly understands the process and precariousness of self-invention and reinvention. After all, she began her life as a flat-chested brunette from Canada and has evolved into a blond bombshell actress and animal rights activist - epitomizing the ideals of the ""California Dream."" As an actress, Pamela is extraordinary to collaborate with because she works hard to understand the vision, and then fully commits to realizing it. She was also comfortable with my introducing elements of documentary into the film, blurring the line between her character and her own experiences with aging and soul searching. This took an enormous amount of bravery on her part, and helping her draw out this strength was extremely enlightening for me as well. 

It was an absolute honor to work with Jane Fonda as the voice of Jackie’s wellness guru, which was also meant to parallel her public story, as well as Dree Hemingway as Luna. Growing up in Malibu, Dree acutely understood her character and brought so much personal experience and depth to the performance. There still remains this idea that intelligence and beauty are two separate qualities that represent two very different kinds of people. I find this to be not only anti-female, but also wholly untrue. For me each of the women in this film actively demonstrates that these traits most certainly do coexist. I hope the film furthers the conversation about our relationship to beauty, aging and technology, as well as each and every individual’s potential for reinvention and transformation.

Initially he sang the songs of Cliff Richards and Tom Jones, until one evening at his local cinema, in glorious Technicolor, he discovered Elvis Presley.  From that point on Elvis became part of his life. This film follows Raja's journey from India to London as we see him moonlighting from his job as a doctor as he entertains the local community. Now 75 years old, for Raja the King more than ever is the guiding light for how he lives his life.

An Introduction to the Animation:

The following images come from negatives salvaged from a recycling plant on the edge of Beijing, where they had been sent to be filtered for their silver nitrate content.Over the years French collector Thomas Sauvin built this archive of more than half a million 35mm negatives, depicting the capital and the life of her inhabitants over the last thirty years.

From 2011 to 2013, Chinese artist Lei Lei selected over 3000 photos to create the animation you are about to see, an almost epic portrait of anonymous humanity.

731,151864795,Pause 2016 Motion Response - A Brief History of Time by CraveFX,"In this conceptual animated short, we aim to create a comedic performance where the past, present and future realities overlap and interact in an environment where time has no start or end. 

A modern take on Zbigniew Rybczyński's Tango, every actor that participates in this space is trapped in an infinite loop where their actions simultaneously bare and yet bare no consequence to another. Starting with a single actor that performs the same series of mundane actions, followed by another and yet another, we start to discover the motivation of these characters and their performance do not simply coexist but are correlated in a complex chain of events. Hilarity ensues as every absurd action cumulates in an amalgamation of intricately choreographed antics.

With wave heights and periods that haven't been seen in quite a long time as well. The wave itself seemed to have weeded the crowd out pretty thin, separating the men from the boys. but if you watch this you'll see that many were also ready to stare this monster of A wave straight in the eye. Kai Lenny, Aaron Gold, Ian Walsh, Shane Dorian, & Albee Layer are just a few names that took on mother natures scariest and most beautiful marvel called Jaws. Please enjoy this video of waves we thought were un-surfable, being surfed.

739,152158702,Nowhere Line: Voices from Manus Island,"An animated short film, narrated by two asylum-seeking men detained in Australia's Manus Island Offshore Processing Centre, recounting the dangerous journeys that brought them to the island and their memories of the riot that erupted in 2014.

For French, Spanish, Italian, German, and Portuguese versions please visit http://www.99.media

----------------------------------------

In July 2013, the Australian Government introduced a controversial immigration policy, transferring asylum seekers arriving by boat to remote offshore detention centres on foreign Pacific islands. Seven months later, the Manus Island centre erupted in violence when police and guards put down protests with sticks, machetes and guns, and 23 year-old asylum seeker Reza Barati was killed.

We spoke to Behrouz and Omar, who are currently detained on Manus Island. This film contains recordings of these conversations.

More Info: jeffdesom.com/holorama

Inspired by the great tradition of optical theatres, Holorama brings several iconic scenes from the history of cinema back to life. From Twin Peaks to The Big Lebowski, Holorama gives these famous scenes a third dimension using a simple holographic process based on a semi-transparent screen, mixing the image of an extremely faithfully built model with the characters extracted from the original scene. A new perspective and a tribute to cinema, accessible to all.

As violence sadly continues to rage on in the Middle East and throughout the world I hope that people are able to turn their heads to the helpers risking their lives and putting others before themselves. Rather than focusing on the hate, I believe it's this kind of selfless kindness that we need to focus on spreading in order to begin to heal this world.

761,141749628,Infinity Room - [TIEE],"Infinity’ is an immersive environment project by Refik Anadol. Project is an integral part of artist’s ongoing ‘Temporary Immersive Environment Experiments’ which is a research on audio/visual installations by using the state called immersion which is the state of consciousness where an immersant’s awareness of physical self is transformed by being surrounded in an engrossing environment; often artificial, creating a perception of presence in a non-physical world.

In this project ‘infinity’ chosen as a concept,a radical effort to deconstruct the framework of this illusory space and transgress the normal boundaries of the viewing experience to set out to transform the conventional flat cinema projection screen into a three dimensional kinetic and architectonic space of visualisation by using contemporary algorithms.

Light is the major element in the experiment, used to blur and interconnect the boundaries between the two realms actual/fictional and physical/virtual. It signifies the threshold between the simulacrum space created by the projection technology, and the physical space where the viewer stands. The experiments will discuss the inherent spatial qualities of immersive virtual environments and their effect on the embodied person. Through the presented framework, the experiments intends to question the relativity of perception and how it informs the apprehension of our surroundings. Rather than approaching the medium as a means of escape into some disembodied techno-utopian fantasy, projects sees itself as a means of return, i.e. facilitating a temporary release from our habitual perceptions and culturally biased assumptions about being in the world, to enable us, however momentarily, to perceive ourselves and the world around us freshly.

Room size: 4M x 4M x 4M
Medium: Four channel Audio/Visual Installation running on custom software. (Original experience: 14 Minutes, 7 algorithms.)

The nine virtual sculptures underlying vitreous resulted from experimental setups by Robert Seidel for generating three-dimensional clusters of fibrous refractions, as well as the gravitational lensing of different volumetric and chromatic densities. Singular elements gravitate towards each other, accumulating in a gigantic sculptural system, where each entity exists with its own visual axis and vanishing point. The impalpable luminous formations create prismatic interactions between the ridges and plateaux of the main colours floating in front of the infinite violet background. 

The multilayered, continuously expanding and decaying system is driven by semi-chaotic processes with localized impulses and their speculative chain reactions. In the spectrum of these possible movements, each singular sculpture becomes an integral component of the whole pictorial force-field. In its asymmetrical orchestration and multitude of spatial-temporal interactions, the abstract-organic images are close in appearance to the concepts of “moving paintings” and “living sculptures” Seidel develops for more than a decade now.

Originally vitreous was conceived as a media façade artwork of 80 × 24 × 14 Meters (Target City Lights, Minneapolis, USA, 2012). It later developed in a large-scale projection of 4 × 14 Meters (German Filmmuseum, Frankfurt, Germany, 2015).

For our first video cover story, The FADER visits the SAVEMONEY rapper at home in Chicago:
thefader.com/2015/09/17/vic-mensa-down-to-start-a-riot-documentary

Last May, The FADER spent a week with the rapper Vic Mensa in Chicago shooting our first video cover story, Down To Start A Riot. Mensa had recently joined Kanye West on stage at the BRIT Awards and was, along with the rest of his SAVEMONEY crew, teetering on the edge of breaking out in a major way. As Mensa's go-to producer and friend-since-grammar-school Stefan Ponce recalls, ""He really did what he always knew he was going to do. Like, damn, this guy is really about to change his life.""
Citing the versatility of SAVEMONEY's sound and the breadth of their projects, the documentary's director Aaron Brown says that, ""It was cool to see what [Mensa and the SAVEMONEY guys] were doing, because they were doing something that has a lot more dimension."" Brown spent time with Vic in the studio, where there was work to be done and fun to be had; followed him through the streets of Hyde Park, where he recalls seeing the body of a slain classmate as a teenager and where he is now stopped by admirers on the street; and he filmed him freestyling on a subway platform.
""I had the idea of trying to explore the genre of documentary, just trying to pick the pieces apart of a rapper,"" Brown says of the dramatic subway station session. ""I was thinking of an acapella verse as a voiceover in a documentary, that's what it was. Just trying to freshen it up. We've all seen a bunch of rap videos and a bunch of documentaries, so it was asking, how can we think about them as one thing.""
With nearly one hundred issues behind us, we are proud to present our first video cover story Down To Start A Riot featuring Vic Mensa and SAVEMONEY. Watch above, and check this space for more documentaries like this in the future.

782,137741568,國立台灣師範大學設計系104級畢業製作/Greedy Germ 掠食,"My graduate film in National Taiwan Normal University, Department of Design in 2015.

The animated protagonists of the film “Greedy Germ” live in a microscopically small world.

They are organisms and germs, friendly and timid little creatures that help each other. 
Oneday, however, a mysterious intruder appears and ruthlessly destroys their peaceful coexistence.

The story was inspired by students’ reflections on pressing issues, such as the subject of food safety. Through the example of the destroyed life structures of the creatures in the film, “Greedy Germ” wants to illustrate that obtaining power is always linked to having a direct effect on society. Abusing power as well as blindly following orders will inevitably lead to injustice.
The film aims to point out the significance of the actions of each individual and thus the responsibility they have for the next generation.

He wants nothing more than to escape his Nicaraguan life of poverty and abuse to live the American dream. The mission north teaches Moacir that unlike many childhood narratives, dreams don't always come true, but the journey can teach you lessons far greater.

For screening info or business inquires email » yalisharon@gmail.com

At Live Unbound we believe in pushing yourself to be greater through what you love and doing whatever it takes to overcome mental and physical constraints. Once in awhile we come across a real life story that embodies this message. A story of falling madly in love with your dream. Then using that passion to overcome the massive obstacles that appear in the journey of realizing it. This is that story. 

This documentary was made possible by Frank Casares who believed in us and funded the project. We had a small crew of 5 people and shot on a RED epic, RED dragon, 5D Mark ii and the Inspire Copter. The biggest challenge was the slow motion skydiving scene which was filmed by Craig O’Brien. Those were shot on the RED dragon at 200 fps. Due to wind, we only had 4 jumps to make it happen but Craig and skydivers Brad Patterson and Dalten Kadow nailed it. 

Currently we’re searching for the next great story to tell. We encourage people to reach out to us if they have one or know somebody who does. 

Thanks for watching!

808,145492089,THE DAYS BURN BLUE - WARP / CHANNEL 4,"I was interested in what a coming-of-age might feel like to a kid in a town outside of London during the 'Age of Austerity'. 

A surreal transition from the expectation of childhood to the exhilaration of emerging adulthood to the quiet realisation that fulfilling your dreams in modern Britain is perhaps an impossibility.

The talent, promise and character I encountered amongst the youth in Huddersfield was overwhelming. Really bright kids with big dreams and little infrastructure to realise them. It makes you the wonder what genius is slipping through the net.

812,144575429,Age of the Farmer,"“65 is the average age of farmers, and there are not enough young farmers to replace them. How did we get here?”**

In the summer of 2015, Eva Verbeeck asked me to join her on a trip throughout the Pacific Northwest to produce a short film on young farmers, that would accompany her photo story for a variety of publications. Having spent much time WWOOFing on organic farms, I knew the importance of this mission. So we loaded our iPods with old bluegrass music and set off in a 1990 Nissan truck, heading from Portland to British Columbia. We offered our labor in exchange for room and board at the farms that we made it to.

This film is an attempt to express some of the thoughts and feelings of the young farmers that we stayed with. Hopefully a little bit of justice was done for all the young farmers out there.

Infinite gratitude to all of the farms that hosted us this summer and kept us filled with organic produce and warmth:

This is what snowboarding is all about!
Watch Northern Exposure – a short film by Pirmin Juffinger & Karsten Boysen about an epic trip to the back of beyond.

Ask any pro rider (any snowboarder at all) about what they love most about snowboarding, and there are two answers that you’ll hear time and time again. “Having fun with your friends!” they’ll tell you, like it’s the first time anyone ever thought of it. “Being in the mountains, surrounded by nature!” they’ll tell you on the chairlift, doing another lap of the snowpark.


But you know what? These answers might be clichés, but they’re true. As human beings, the needs to bond with our fellow human, connect with Mother Nature, and explore new places are as deeply ingrained in us as the need to eat, drink, breathe and laugh. So it’s no surprise that when it comes to our preferred flavour of snow porn, nothing beats a good old-fashioned travel edit. No need for triple corks or ultra slo-mo when you’ve got a crew of friends exploring one of the most beautiful places on Earth.

""Slowly Rising"" suggested to me the image of the sun.

A seed was born beneath the sun, the source of all existence.
The seed absorbed the light. It created more seeds like itself, gradually increasing in number.

Time passed, but still their numbers slowly continued to rise,
and before long they were quietly swallowed up by their own shadows.

After everything that had lived had perished, nothing but an empty world remained.
There, once again, an environment where the next living things could grow silently began to spread.",2015-10-17T05:37:53-04:00,1020239577,210,144503984,24,93264,1192,https://i.vimeocdn.com/video/542351525_780x439.webp

Nature has engineered its own actuators, as well as the efficient material composition, geometry and structure to utilize its actuators and achieve functional transformation. Based on the natural phenomenon of hygromorphic transformation, we introduce a specific type of living cells as nanoactuators that react to body temperature and humidity change. The living nanoactuator can be controlled by electrical signal and communicate with the virtual world as well.

Animation Breakdown: https://vimeo.com/157913307

Pete's Story is a true account of a boy that suffered from his mother's violence over his childhood years in the UK. NSPCC and Lovers invited me to create this frame by frame watercolour ink animation to communicate the story’s haunting and delicate atmosphere.

NSPCC is the leading children's charity in the UK and is widely known for its long fight for childhood protection. The film was used to reach out potential donors and to create awareness among young people about child abuse and what NSPCC can do to help.

The idea was to convey a mixture of fear, solitude and the imminence of violence confined inside this labyrinthic house, in contrast with the green touch points that show potential (but unused, in this case) interfaces between Pete and NSPCC. I worked five months to create this watercolour animation frame by frame, on paper, and then compose it digitally in post production.

Zack came to us with the idea of telling a story through dance :
A love story that is tangled in addiction. We see the consequences of a lover who is struggling with her partners disease and the person he once was, only to succumb to his demons and dive head first into his addiction.
 
The choreography was created and rehearsed over a period of several days with Tamara, who is known also as the French singer Shy'm rather than a dancer. It was shot in an abandoned warehouse in Paris, formerly used for creating glassware and silverware.

Since the beginning of time people are fascinated by stories of hero’s. But did you know there is a fundamental structure that's lies beneath all these tales of fantasy. Joseph Campbell, a famous mythologist, was the first to discover similarities within all ancient myths. He called it the Monomyth. According to him there are 17 stages in which every hero has to walk through one way or the other. 

Christopher Vogler a Hollywood development executive was inspired by the writings of Campbell. He wrote his own adaptation guide for hollywood screenwriters.

In the hero’s journey his 12 stages are visualized by using iconic blockbuster movies that follow the same structure of storytelling.

851,141518601,SUMER · Award Winning 3D Animated Short,"For unknown reasons, the Earth's ionosphere has weakened dramatically during the course of the last century, resulting in the collapse of the entire ecosystem. Earth has become an increasingly hostile and uninhabitable place and with no shield to protect it, it is at the full mercy of meteors.

All animal and plant species perished decades ago. All that remains is one small group of humans who attempt to resist the hostility and hardness of the external environment from SUMER, the last hive city in the world, which has been specifically designed to keep the population alive through oxygen supply systems.

The media manipulates the available information in a manner that is purposely designed to keep people obsessed on the potential of the space exodus, letting any hope of prevailing on earth go.
A young boy, Hermes, lives alone in a compartment, the property of the government, which is located close to the wall that delimits the city, an area that is highly guarded by the SSW (SUMER Security Watchers).
While observing the desert from the roof of a building, Hermes suddenly sees something that grabs his attention…

-------------------------------------------------------------------

In October 2014, SUMER started to be screened internationally throughout the festival circuit. It has been officially selected by more than 50 festivals, including the “Cleveland International Film Festival”, which is an Academy Qualifying Festival, and the prestigious “New Port Beach Film Festival”. Furthermore, SUMER has won 14 Festivals: Irvine Film Festival and Phoenix Comicon, among others.

Moto Borgatoro

Part documentary, part pulp action film, all love and pure passion: ""Moto Borgatoro"" follows curmudgeon/savant mechanic Peter Boggia and the birth of his custom 1979 Moto Guzzi Le Mans into creation.

Mind you this film is not your normal bike build movie by design; no grinder sparks, no silhouette shots, no dramatic music. Been there seen that. This one is pure adrenaline, and hopefully tightens your pants like riding the bike would.

The film has received praise from the limited amount of industry people given the opportunity to experience. Filmmaker and Moto-enthusist alike claim that it's got ""Fellini roots with Tarantino fruits"". We love praise that rhymes.

Love bikes, hate bike, or know nothing about them, this film is juicy enough for anyone to quickly fall in love with Peter and his bad-ass machine.

About the making of the film:
Shot on a Arri SR 16mm film camera, BMCC, and two 5Ds. Edited and sound design in Premiere Pro CC with some light AE magic.

After the success of STUXNET, a virus written by the United States to destroy Iranian uranium enrichment facilities, the U.S. government could no longer deny it was developing cyber weapons meant to do physical damage.  With US companies and agencies under constant attack from state-sponsored Chinese hackers, it is only a matter of time before tensions boil over and more sensitive infrastructure is targeted.  As more of our devices (cars, homes, etc) become connected, we will become more and more vulnerable to the physical threat of cyber warfare.

867,60512889,BEAT starring Ben Whishaw,"""BEAT is a masterful short film: explosive, involving, tense, different, and almost entirely dialogue-free"" 
- Screen International. 

BEAT is an award-winning short film by Aneil Karia about a man walking a paper-thin line between profound joy and complete hopelessness. Shot on 16mm, the film is about the sprawling chaos and oppressive loneliness that coexist in the city, and a man who finds his withdrawal from the world challenged by a visceral force. 

The film has screened at over 40 festivals worldwide including BFI London Film Festival, Edinburgh Film Festival, Warsaw, Rhode Island, Melbourne, Brest European Short Film Festival, Slamdance and Encounters, where the film won the New European Talent Award.

SURGE - Aneil's first feature - will star Ben Whishaw and is currently in development with Rook's Nest and Creative England. Find out more at www.aneilkaria.co.uk

874,133909196,TRIBE,"Produced for Rolling Stone Magazine. (rollingstone.com)

Directed and Edited by Nicolas Heller
Cinematography by Oliver Lucian Anderson
Produced by Alexandra Eaton

Retro fashion has always been a popular form of expression, but the members of New York-based art and music collective the Tribe are taking their love for the Eighties and Nineties beyond the surface of style.

For the past the three years, the Tribe's six core members — King Kid Love, Manolo Mike, Chill, Prynce, Teddy and Paulie — have looked to the past for not only an artistic outlet but a means of creating a community of likeminded individuals. ""We've come together to live the same vision,"" King Kid Love, a musician, explains.

While an old-school hip-hop aesthetic is integral to their style, each member has a different dream: Paulie is a stylist, Manolo Mike a poet. ""We knew we could come together with these different ideas and succeed together with having one whole vision,"" Kid Love continues. ""That vision is Tribe NYC.""

Kid Love remembers feeling disengaged from the interests and trends kids his age had while growing up. His unique sense of style — flat-top haircut, skinny jeans — isolated him from his peers, so he turned to books and music for comfort. On his iPod, he had nothing but Eighties and Nineties hip-hop, the kind of music his dad would play. ""I didn't know what was going on in music,"" he says.

All the members of the Tribe are based in Brooklyn and in their early twenties. They studied films like Juice and White Men Can't Jump as well as old music videos for stylistic inspiration, finding Nineties style to have longevity because of its authenticity.

For the Tribe, they see their community as an impending revolution. ""Like Tupac said, 'I may not be the one to start the revolution, but I'm going to be the one to spark the mind,'"" Kid Love reflects. ""10, 20, 30 years from now, people are always going to remember Tribe NYC.""

877,122009868,NO-A  [Short Film],"Award winning graduation film NO-A completed at the Savannah College of Art and Design by a core team of 8 students.

The world is a desolate, unforgiving place in this action sci-fi with a surprising amount of heart. We follow NO-A (Noah), as he attempts to rescue Aixa, the young woman that created him. In his desperate attempt to save her, he must face an unknown enemy force and fight to keep them both alive.

883,137184014,"Bahamas, ""WAVES""","""A benevolent queen of the beach"", Carol Schultz has a lifetime of lessons learned from the ocean. A native of San Francisco, she spends her days at the beach, swimming in the rugged cold Pacific. At 82 years old, she credits the sun and sea as her fountain of youth. 
As Bahama's, Afie Jurvanen sings of the ocean's cold kiss, Carol's story emerged in a beautifully symbiotic and natural way. With a frenetic, archival feel we captured a true day in Carol's life. Pairing these raw visuals with the beautifully swelling 'Waves', a unique pairing was created.

Director's Note:

“I am a non-violent, pro-war, latte sipping hipster who wants world peace and instead posts sick landscape instagram pics. #blessed. I am a walking contradiction. I am a ""Weekend Warrior"" -- someone who takes half-measures to change themselves and the world. That's why the term ""Weekend Warrior"" isn't exclusive to the army reservists, and the film, in my opinion, is not a surface level parody of the military. It's a critique of my comfortable, entitled and selfish life.  And so ironically, if you are actually a ""Weekend Warrior"", and a member of the Canadian Forces in any capacity, I don't think you're a ""Weekend Warrior"". By enlisting, you've already taken a step that many of us in our comfort zones would never dare to take. If I was brave enough, maybe I would have joined the military and put myself through hell until I came out the other side a true fearless hero.

924,132068126,SEVEN SEVEN,"An animation telling my story of the London bombings.

Direction, Design and Animation: Georgina Ferguson and Eduarda Lima . Sound and Music: Philippe Lenzini. 

On July 7th 2005 I was one of the Londoners involved in the King’s Cross bombings. That morning I found myself on the carriage behind the one that was bombed, in which 26 people lost their lives.

I have never publicly spoken about what happened that day. Nor do a lot of my friends know that I was even involved. A year ago I realised that it was going to be the 10 year anniversary this July and decided that this would be a good time to share my experience. I am no wordsmith so I thought it might be best to use animation to communicate my story; as a motion graphic designer this felt most appropriate to me.

This is my story of Seven Seven, and how a stranger’s kindness helped me get out and start to move on. I never asked my guardian angel’s name, something I regret as I’ve never been able to really thank him. This animation is my way of giving them thanks - I really hope it can reach him.

For me, this film is about more than just personal catharsis and sharing an experience. Its about an act of remembrance, tribute and gratitude...

We all have different starting points in life. Some of us come into the world swinging from the vines while others are born into quicksand. Samsung invited me to look back on my past that I have been so good at hiding all these years to show that even against all odds you can make your dreams come true. 
To every person out there with huge dreams and huge obstacles, whether you are 12-years-old or 65, black, white, rich, poor, we are all fighting something and I hope this film can inspire even just one person to push through the thick fog and persevere. You are SO capable and you should just force it to happen no matter what the weight is on your shoulders and how hopeless it seems!

We used only three Ultra primes lenses, 16, 40, and 85mm - and a Red One MX camera - used hollywoodblack magic 1/4 and 1/8 for filtration and minimal lighting - mostly a joker 800 bounced and just a 1x1 lite panel.  We had a really beautiful house to shoot in.  Added film grain in post - gorilla grain - just to take some of the digital edge off.

Why not shoot on the Sony F35?  Because we wanted to shoot up to 100 FPS.  And why not the Alexa or Amira? - Because, wait maybe I could have scrounged one up from someone - oh well - we still got out of the old red one mx some really nice stuff and I don’t think people will be commenting that in the comment section - but maybe they will - so let’s see!  Anyway in my testing perhaps the only camera would have made more of a difference for this would have been to shoot on film (but cost prohibitive for something of this scale), or maybe we should have shot f35 and just red one for the overcranked 100 FPS stuff but there would have been a possibility that the look would have not synced perfectly.  Anyway!

Anh was a really amazing director to work with - and the whole production was really great.  Anh has a special certain sensitivity to actor’s performances that was refreshing and also has a really great visual eye and knack for visual design.  I was honored to work on this film.

For the coloring I used a visioncolor 500Tungsten cineon lut from reddragoncolor2 and redlogfilm to convert to Cineon and from there applied a kodak film print - I think 6000k don't remember the name of the film stock.  I did a lot of secondary color correction to bring up faces and added gorilla grain and defocused the edges because I just watched Trois Colors: Blue and it has this look.  That film looks so amazing - but anyway inspired by that.

The challenge with the red footage is how it works in tungsten lighting - skintones in this vs more daylight environments - also just how it handles saturation in general.  I'm less technical about this than I wish, but playing with log level correction was able to fix up some skintones.  Overall though the red one mx has a very robust image and a grain pattern I like naturally and I like how it does it slow motion.

This film explores the practice, the methods and the need for habitat restoration in British Columbia's temperate rainforests. At Central Westcoast Forest Society, we see a clear connection between healthy landscapes and healthy communities. Our coast is one of the most beautiful places in the world, but decades of destructive logging, mining, and development practices have left vast expanses of our temperate rainforest in need of a helping hand. Many wildlife species have become endangered and wild salmon runs that once teemed with life are struggling to survive. Our job is to get the hard work done, and to get it done now.

Whether it’s design or visual art or music, Chaz Bundick wants to make things that are approachable, then relatable, then, maybe, useful, or at the very least not so complicated that it becomes intimidating. To him, design is a puzzle – there’s what it looks like, and there’s why it looks like that.

He compares his feeling when he’s making art to the feeling he has when working through a puzzle. “It makes me feel present, if anything. It makes me feel like I’m actually doing something, getting something done,” he says. “To turn your brain off for a second and take a break from craziness – ‘Got to feed the dog.’ ‘Got to get gas.’ ‘Got to get food.’”",2015-06-21T20:48:51-04:00,356345293,182,131506757,81,103332,2990,https://i.vimeocdn.com/video/523785427_780x439.webp

But it's not until the sun goes down that he discovers the true extent of the danger - it seems the town is about to experience the effects of a mysterious infection that turns not only humans – but
animals too – into zombies. Australian wildlife has never been so terrifying…

Octopod Films and Veritas Entertainment, in association with Deadpan Films, are proud to bring you 'Waterborne' - the world's first zombie kangaroo film, and a prequel for a feature film currently in development. 

Turn down the lights, put on your headphones (for extra sound design awesomeness) and enjoy!

Shot on location in regional Victoria, Australia,  the film only came about due to the amazing support from over 250 crowdfunding backers, who helped fund the creation of an incredible zombie kangaroo puppet, as well as a digitally animated zombieroo.

The film has screened at over 50 festivals around the world (including big genre festivals such as Fantasia, Fantastic Fest, Sitges International Film Festival) and won multiple awards.

955,130165596,RICE MAPPING,"CONCEPT:
In Japan, rice is more than a mere food source. It has spiritual significance for the Japanese due to its use as an offering to deities in rituals and ceremonies. We took on the challenge of distilling Japanese aesthetics onto this cultural symbol.

We created the world’s smallest projection mapping that brings together Japan’s ancient values and state-of-the-art technology. As it is being viewed, the texture of the “rice” begins to change so that it is no longer just rice. This reflects the ancient Japanese belief in shogyo mujo (the impermanence of worldly things), which is embodied in the saying: “all creation is infinitely transitory with forms and values changing in each moment.”

12 days after this video was uploaded and shared on Facebook, we have received overwhelmingly warm responses from the public in Vietnam and overseas. As I am writing this, a great many are offering to help the kids. A few friends and myself are developing an action plan, most possibly a mobile school and creativity centre as the most immediate goal, before we launch an official project and start to accept support in kinds or manpower.   

There may be a happy ending to follow, after all. We'll see.)

When creating experimental animations I often use intuition and visualization techniques to come up with ideas. Often times these ideas come to me as a flash of insight. Other times I must plumb the depths of my psyche to find novel approaches to making moving images. The film “Inner Space Artifacts” was a journey of deep excavation into the world of abstract ideas. The moving objects in the animation I regard as “artifacts” that I uncovered and shaped into ephemeral moving digital sculptures.",2015-06-03T16:30:37-04:00,314196592,130,125292332,64,307251,2515,https://i.vimeocdn.com/video/515366806_780x439.webp

Ghostly and compelling images draw the viewer into a conflict that repeats itself. After losing everything, material possessions, love, and perhaps even sanity, a robot injects the male character with a futuristic drug that lets him re-live precious moments that once made him feel alive. Traveling back to memories frozen in time, our character wishes to make the past his future.

993,126726032,Walk in Shanghai,"With its futuristic skyline and sprawling network of streets, subway lines, and highways, Shanghai represents not just China’s unbridled dynamism, but also the rapidly maturing global economy. The bustling city of Shanghai, however, holds a further, complex and equally exhilarating narrative nestled at the feet of its towering skyscrapers. ‘Walk in Shanghai’ tells the story of the lively, multifaceted and above all else, very human experience unfolding at the street level of this massive city.

To guide you through the streetscape is JT Singh. As he leads the viewer on his curious adventure through central Shanghai, he glances around corners, weaves through crowds, and with a barely perceptible pause here or an impulsive turn there, stumbles into the unhinged entropy that flows through the hidden alleys, accidental views, and captivating scenes embedded in the city’s vibrant street life. The peculiar reversal of the city’s movement against his own distinguishes his story from that of the other 24 million people taking 24 million walks in Shanghai. It’s through a heightened focus on one man’s seemingly unstructured journey that we discover the ultimate protagonist of this story: the transcendent power of using your legs for discovering a city.

‘Walk in Shanghai’ is only an introductory tour of Shanghai's urban streets. The remaining story of Shanghai’s suspense and beauty can only be experienced in person, and through using your legs as the main mode of transport. Shanghai in particular is a great city for walking as its downtown maintains its extensive walkable neighborhoods through the historic preservation of its urban fabric. Above all, JT Singh’s playful artistry is a celebration of the beauty of walking in cities. A visceral pleasure made possible by walkable and human scale urban environments. Walk on!

999,126521711,"Sinead Harnett 'She Ain't Me"" Official Music Video","The video was about capturing an insight into Sinead's world, just a normal girl hanging out in her bedroom from day to night. I wanted a mood that felt personal and intimate. This was then highlighted by the animation. I wanted this to feel innocent, primitive and bold and I felt the nature of doing this animation for real as camera less animation (a technique pioneered by the incredible Norman McLaren) would capture an insight and honesty that matches the emotion of the track. 

All animation done by hand directly onto 35mm film. BTS pics below.

Process

We began by shooting on 35mm film. We almost had an entirely female crew too. Which was great.  Why does this not happen more please!? 

The film was then scanned and made digital so we could edit it. The day to night timelapse was fun to capture too. I wanted a 7 second timelapse which meant I needed 175 frames. With the help of the awesome DP Katie Swain who designed the lighting to replicate that feeling of daylight changing to nighttime. While nearly all the crew plus the commissioner James Hackett were allocated control over different lights to gradually dim down and up over the 3 minutes we took to execute this effect. We shot 1 frame per sec and ended with 180 frames. 

Once edited I then worked with an animator to create a digital animatic to give us an indication of what some of the animation might look like on the footage. Thanks Daniel Murtha! 

We then graded the film and then had the film reprinted back on to 35mm negs which we sent to our animator. Enter the very talented and highly skilled, Em Cooper.

I'm not sure anything could have prepared us for the delicate execution of painting directly on to exposed film!  Experienced as she was Em had still never painted directly on to the negs.  Em then had to design her own contraption to allow her to go back and forth on the reel. She also ended up using coloured pens instead of paint as she could be more precise on the film and the colours were better. 

For the initial previews Em took photos on her SLR through a magnify glass which she then collated in an editing programme to make a small preview quicktime. It was quite exhilarating seeing the first preview and watching the concept become tangible. If you look carefully we switch between 25fps and 12.5fps animation and live action at 25fps. As it would have been even more time consuming doing 25fps animation on all clips. But I think this really adds to the charm.  

We had 3 rolls of negs for our animator. She only used one and what you see is the one master reel with painted frames. This reel of film is a work of art in it's own right. When the final animated clip was complete the final scan was a crucial step to seeing if it would all work. 

Finally once re-scanned I was surprised by how well the colours came out. We then had minimal tweaking in the final grade for delivery. 

A huge thank you to everyone who believed and made this very unusual project happen.

1000,126783354,Red Bull - Melodies for the Lemurs (Full Length),"I was honored with a quite sweet award from the European skateboard community, the 'best film-maker of 2014'. Along with a trophy, Red Bull pretty much told me I can choose any place on earth and film a short piece. I scrambled through a world atlas and thought that Madagascar would be the ideal place to celebrate this award as well as explore the streets of this exotic island along the Indian Ocean with some good friends.

Text and French interpretation by Kirill Korobkov

Here is Kirill Korobkov giving a short intro to our trip: Madagascar sounds a bit like something from the pages of a fantasy novel. Everyone knows that this place exists, but it’s so remote that it is almost like a myth. The big island resides on Africa’s east side and is a rare destination for outsiders, isolated by both sea and distance. In terms of the skateboarding? Madagascar just might be the perfect mix of originality, adventure, vacation and the unpredictable unknown.

1005,126330316,Everest - A Tribute to the Fallen,"Imagine a 1500 ft tidal wave of snow, rock and debris headed straight towards you. This was our reality on April 25th, 2015 at Mt. Everest basecamp when a 7.8 magnitude earthquake triggered a massive avalanche at Mt. Everest Basecamp that claimed 16 lives and critically injured 50+ men and women.

I shot as much as I could before putting the cameras down to help the critically injured and wounded. 16 people lost their lives including my friend Dan Fredinburg - a man who loved life and lived it to the fullest. I did my best as a filmmaker to document the process even though my heart was bleeding from the loss of life. As much as I tried to pretend I was ok, I simply was not. A part of me died that day. I was in shock.


For the next 3 days, I documented the rescue efforts from 17,500 ft above sea level. Over 50 people were successfully evacuated and over 70 rescued from high above the mountain.


Drained, exhausted and sick from neglecting to take care of myself, I secluded myself in my tent while on Everest and proceeded to edit to the best of my ability, an honest portrayal of the events through our team’s eyes. It took me a long time to ‘feel’ the piece, to select the right music and to establish the correct tone. In the end, I stayed up until 1:27am, 3 days after the Earthquake, completing the edit. My internet upload speed was 21kb/sec, which was incredibly painful.


It’s important to remember that this is only a single perspective, many others will have experienced far greater devastation than us. We salute all of the brave men and women who stepped up in the moment to come to the aid of their fellow human beings. It was a herculean effort on the part of hundreds to rescue, recover and evacuate those affected.


My heart goes out to my friend Dan Fredinburg, may your soul rest in peace.

1015,124307239,TRANSFORMING,"“TRANSFORMING” is 3D Printed Nail stopmotion animation.

Created by Planner/Director Mizuki Kawano and Producer Yuna Takayama from Taiyokikaku Co., Ltd.
The company's computer graphics artists produced the animation data based on the designs created by the Manicurist, Hatsuki Furutani.
Then the data was printed into three-dimensional artificial nails by full color 3D printer, “ProJet 660 Pro”.
Total of 521 nails were produced, and the thinnest part of the nails were only 0.56mm.
We attached and replaced the nails to the actual human hand, and filmed frame by frame. 
This stop motion animation was created without using any computer graphics.

1017,124545160,FITC Toronto 2015 - Opening Titles,"OUR THEME FOR 2015 : EVOLUTION

Will Reid, Designer, FITC Toronto 2015 creative.
http://www.willreid.ca

“Evolution is defined as the process by which different kinds of living organisms are thought to have developed and diversified from earlier forms during the history of the earth. [This year’s creative] is a direct illustration of this definition. It begins with organic matter and evolves into a space suit, representing the modern day man at the peak of our current technology. Evolution is also defined as the gradual development of something, especially from a simple to a more complex form. Technology, but more importantly, the creative process as a whole is a prime example of this as it parallels the evolution of human beings. FITC, year after year, shares this constant progress, growth and development on a, now, international scale. From humble beginnings as a simple Flash conference, FITC has evolved into an international destination. It features some of the most audacious, innovative speakers teaching and pushing the boundaries of technology and motivating others to evolve their creativity. Future, Innovation, Technology and Creativity; FITC spells evolution.”

What is FITC?

A three-day professional celebration of the best the world has to offer in design, web development, media and innovation in creative technologies. It’s a conference that both unites and transforms the industry – assembling its major leaders and players from across North America and the world. FITC Toronto transforms the Hilton Toronto into an international mecca for the digitally creative, abuzz with Creative Directors from multinational ad agencies, studio heads from Canada’s most sought-after digital production companies, the world’s most surprising digital artists, and freelancers, cultural influencers and tech lovers from all walks.",2015-04-09T13:44:28-04:00,673708447,190,125089843,76,80674,2750,https://i.vimeocdn.com/video/517757517_780x439.webp

1021,124429939,INSULA ORCHESTRA / Orpheo’s Mind,"Insula orchestra s’associe à l’agence de création visuelle Superbien pour réaliser une œuvre vidéo abstraite et onirique intitulée Orpheo’s Mind, sur un extrait d’Orfeo ed Euridice de Gluck, l’aria « Che puro Ciel ». Cet air, une des plus belles pages d’Orfeo ed Euridice, est interprété par le célèbre contre-ténor Franco Fagioli et Insula orchestra sous la direction de Laurence Equilbey.

Le travail d’Insula orchestra et de Superbien donne à cette oeuvre une double dimension : audio et visuelle. Le spectateur est transporté par cette poésie hypnotique célébrant la beauté et exprimant l’espace, la fuite du temps et le tumulte des émotions vécues par Orphée lors de sa traversée des enfers.

Le nuage suspendu au centre de ce poème audiovisuel incarne l’illumination spirituelle et l’ascension de l’esprit. La vidéo projetée sur ce nuage ainsi que la lumière diffusée en son sein y sont travaillées en tant que matières. La lumière ne vit qu’à travers le prisme du nuage dont la structure se compose de deux matériaux complémentaires : le plexiglass transparent et angulaire contrastant avec le tulle vaporeux et plus opaque. À cela s’ajoute une projection vidéo ambiante renforçant l’immersion du spectateur dans l’esprit d’Orphée. L’alliance de l’esthétisme pur de la sculpture et de la beauté de l’aria de Gluck affirme la modernité de l’ensemble tout en soutenant la poésie de l’œuvre musicale.


Insula Orchestra partners Superbien, creative agency, to realize abstract video « Orpheo’s Mind » on Orfeo ed Euridice extract by Gluck « Che puro Ciel ». The song is interpreted by the famous counter-tenor Franco Fagioli and Insula orchestra under the leadership of Laurence Equilbey. The audience is transported by this hypnotic poetry celebrating the beauty and expressing space, the flight of time and Orpheo ‘s tumult of feelings when he crossed the hells. The cloud suspended at the center of this audivisual poetry represents inner illumination and spirit ascension. Videos projeted on the cloud and lights are processed further as material. Light and video differents technologies mixed with the sculpture aesthetics and the track beauty affirms this musical work’s modernity and poetry.

Double-Blind No.1 is a VFX design project by Zenon Kohler, Jasper St Aubyn West, Ian Anderson, Ricky Marks and Raoul Teague. Their self-imposed brief was to produce a collection of unique shots by experimenting with different styles and creative techniques.

With access to all of the raw footage, each artist selected shots they felt would best inspire their individual creativity. There was no expected outcome or planned narrative, instead the result shows what happens when five artists are let loose with a goat, a gasmask, and their imaginations.

Seven years ago the idea of his new photography book, Found at Sea, would have seemed ludicrous to him; he was still working a mile down in the mines and hadn’t shot a single frame. Collins crawled out of the mines after blowing out a knee—“No shock absorbers left,” he says—and bought a camera with the payout. In the short years since, Collins has transitioned from subterranean to submarine and become arguably the most inventive water photographer in Australia.",2015-03-25T07:00:48-04:00,78770205,257,123943300,93,161312,3470,https://i.vimeocdn.com/video/513475830_780x439.webp

1048,121101874,Hockey Sounds,"Although I’m looking forward to spring/summer, I’ll be sad to see our backyard rink go.  It’s been another great winter for outdoor skating and my two boys took full advantage.  Despite getting his butt kicked by his older brother, my youngest son’s skating drastically improved over the last 3 months.  No children were harmed during the filming of this video.   Thanks to my wife Kelli for helping me shoot this past weekend and for putting up with my non-stop camera obsession.  In this (quick cut style) video, either a person, object or thing is centered in every scene.  Here’s a whole bunch of good ol’ Canadian hockey in under one minute.  Crank it up on a good sound system or use headphones for a better overall viewing experience.

Eunice Akoth is a fourth grade student at the Kibera School for Girls. She has a passion for poetry, an aptitude for math, and a love of the book Matilda by Roald Dahl. She has lived all her life in Kibera, and though she is only ten years old, she dreams of traveling the world, from New York to Melbourne, before returning to Kenya and becoming a doctor. Though she has been lucky enough to receive a free education, and is celebrated as an exceptionally bright student by her teachers, she also represents the far-too-common case of a girl who must overcome extreme obstacles in order to find a path out of poverty.

I created this video simply because I love nature. I always found the flower's timelapses fabulous, but most of the time they are made with a black background. Then I told myself to make a beautiful flower's timelapse with coloured and vintage backgrounds. To me, the 60's / 70's is the most representative period for the flowers. This is a way to pay tribute to them.

The film is an evolving journey through a subtle push and pull between masculinity and femininity, captured entirely in one unbroken shot, utilising in-camera effects in a world populated by out-scaled physical props inspired by Faye Toogood's in store realisation of Agender.

1065,121473419,white Out,"A short film about winter.

Snow is particularly joyful in how it transforms everything it coversThe brightness of its white forces the iris in your eye to shut way down, and suddenly everything that isn’t snow is in silhouette or defined by shadow. The world becomes a high-contrast graphic representation of itself. This distillation of form allowed me to focus on painting pure motion in relation to the winter landscape.

This film is composed of approximately 2,250 watercolor paintings on paper. It is  a kind of winter companion to my film “L’Eau Life,” although here the water is frozen and therefore much easier to paint — because painting snow mostly means leaving the paper white.

The music is by Shay Lynch, and wonderfully captures the endless cascade of the montage while giving the film a kind of emotional elegance in spite of its vaudevillian pratfalls.This film and essay originally appeared in my blog The Animated Life in the New York Times, Opinion.",2015-03-06T10:58:23-05:00,650280000,181,121818683,86,162397,2412,https://i.vimeocdn.com/video/510353547_780x439.webp

1080,120514986,THE BOY WHO COULDN'T SLEEP AND NEVER HAD TO proof-of-concept,"This is a proof-of-concept short for an adaptation of the award-winning novel THE BOY WHO COULDN’T SLEEP AND NEVER HAD TO. Director Dan Eckman (“Community,” “Mystery Team,” DERRICK comedy) and his frequent collaborators Meggie McFadden and DC Pierson are adapting from Pierson’s original novel.

What if you discovered you can do things no other human can do?

What if you had the power to turn anything you can imagine into reality?

But what if it wasn’t you? What if it was your best friend?

Darren, a high school outcast who’s spent his whole life wishing the world was more like it is in comic books, gets launched into an adventure way cooler than anything he could dream up when he discovers his best friend has a superpower. But now that he’s seemingly gotten his wish, Darren realizes that what he really wanted was to be the hero, not just a sidekick.

Composed of equal parts action, humor, and heart, THE BOY WHO COULDN’T SLEEP AND NEVER HAD TO is a highly serialized sci-fi adventure with classic coming-of-age struggles like friendship, sex, jealousy, and betrayal playing out on a superhuman scale.

Dan, Meggie, and DC are repped by Kaplan/Perrone and their lawyer Lev Ginsburg at Ginsburg Daniels LLP. Inquiries can also be directed to whocouldntsleep@gmail.com.",2015-02-24T15:15:56-05:00,215045724,318,120419055,53,181113,2233,https://i.vimeocdn.com/video/508241723_780x439.webp

In an era when live-recorded orchestral scores are a dying breed, Thompson and Fung brought the Edmonton Symphony and ProCoro Canada to one of North America's premiere acoustic spaces: Edmonton's Winspear Centre.  Over three days, over 70 classical musicians and a large team of sound recording engineers recorded a remarkable score, capped with a sold-out public performance.  See what happened!

The three-part series THE GREAT HUMAN ODYSSEY premiered in Canada on CBC-TV in February 2015, and will broadcast on PBS NOVA in the USA and around the world on major broadcasters later this year.

A little info on the Moon shot - 

We filmed in Western Utah. I used the Sony F55 and a Canon 800mm lens with a 2x converter, so effectively it turned it into a 1600mm lens. With the 2x converter the widest you can go is an F/11 so light became a bit of an issue. I found the hill we shot our moon skater Daniel on through Google Earth. Luckily it was only about an hour drive from my house so it allowed us to scout the location multiple times over the course of about a month. I had seen a similar shot here https://vimeo.com/56298775 and kinda took the info I could find on it to piece together what we wanted. I was shooting from a little over a mile away in massive field. Because this was on the top of a dirt hill, we had to build a 100-foot track made out of plywood for Daniel to skate on. The main difficulties at that point were lining up the moon, the skater, and the camera, and then just finding the moon in the sky, which, when you're focused on such a small area and there's nothing to visually reference, because it's pitch black, can be very difficult. We had guys up on the hill with flashlights trying to marl edge of frame, which helped. We ultimately ended up shooting three nights in a row. This was from the third night. First night we got it pretty well, but it was dusky and not totally dark. The second night was a total bust. We ended up being wrong in our camera positioning by about 300 feet each night. So when the moon first started to peak we had to grab everything and run until it was lined up, set down the camera, find the moon again, refocus, etc. Slightly stressful :) From the time the moon first touches the horizon line to when it's already fully above it is a little under 2 minutes. Ultimately there were probably 20 people who helped make this shot possible.",2015-02-09T07:47:06-05:00,248988635,183,116562391,28,62772,1766,https://i.vimeocdn.com/video/503029778_780x439.webp

1100,118621591,A NEW BREED: Content With Content - Part 4/5,"With Matthew Frost acting as Matthew Frost, the ordinary becomes extraordinary.

Blending the efficiency of a commercial film with a touch of humour and the fashion world’s tendency to take itself too seriously, Matthew Frost creates a genre all his own.
 
Bringing us into his NYC radius, the esteemed filmmaker experiences things from the other side of the camera. Directed by Adam Beck and Paul Johnston, Matthew weaves his inimitable touch of satire into everyday happenings.

His modus operandi: leaving just enough room for those “I don’t know what the fuck is going to happen” moments. Slap a little bit of music on there and milling about has never looked so good.
 
ABOUT A NEW BREED
Times are changing, and a new breed of artists are closing the gap on their ambitions; relieved of obstacles that were hindering a decade ago. When a musician's Soundcloud uploads turn into a world tour, and a photographer's steady Instagram following evolves into an international campaign, it's clear to see that more than ever, being a creator is synonymous with being self-made.

1111,116131870,Reggie,"One thing I learned from sitting in traffic is that nothing ever happens. Yup, exactly, hours of ‘nothing ever happens’. Thousands of people staring into their phones, waiting for the lights to change.  
On this particular day, however, God prepared something very special for me, I met Reggie.
You know that awkward moment at the stoplight when a man or woman in need walks by your window asking for some pocket change and you start anxiously pretending to be looking at your phone? That’s how I met Reggie.
He approached my car with his tiny jar looking for change, I reached into my wallet to see if I had any, and all I could find was a $20 bill. “That’s too much for him”, I thought. At this time, as he was close enough to me so that I could see his face. I was stunned! I have never seen anything like that before. His face was disfigured from burn marks and his speech was affected.

I didn’t feel any fear or pity, I just remember having a very clear thought that this man needs the $20 bill in my wallet way more than I did. The man said ‘thank you’, and kept going.
Have you ever met someone with a story? This man had a story, and I decided I wanted to learn it.
As he was walking away, I said:
What’s your name?
Reggie, he said.
What happened to you, Reggie? Considering his looks, I thought that’s a questions he’s been asked many times before.
I was in a fire.
Did your house catch on fire?
No, I set myself on fire…
I was stunned. Why would anyone set themselves on fire? I couldn't squeeze a word out for some time. The light was about to change, but I was determined to find out more. I asked Reggie if I could come back to hear his story, and he kindly agreed.

I was back on Reggie’s corner 2 days later. In the next 8 minutes you’ll hear his story. This accidental encounter has brought a lot of positivity in my life. I only ask that you pay close attention to what he’s got to say. His current attitude towards life, driven by the conclusions he made through his difficult times, is just as important as the journey itself. 
We honk at other cars in traffic, we cuss at slow drivers, we are so angry and impatient all the time. And then, there’s Reggie. He carries the burden and pain of his prior mistakes, and yet there’s not a glimpse of negativity. Reggie isn’t blaming anyone, he isn’t out for revenge or justice. Reggie is, for me, a refreshing reminder to be grateful and aware of all the beautiful people and precious moments in our lives. He also reminded me that there is always more to someone than what appears on the surface. We’re too quick to judge, to place a label and dismiss, to hide our faces in our phones to avoid eye contact. 
So, my friend, stop for a moment and listen. After all, you might be sitting in traffic right now, and someone with a story like Reggie’s could be walking past you.

1124,116596161,A NEW BREED: Get Miles Away - Part 1/5,"When unpredictable weather conditions boast a 50/50 success rate, the odds are in your favour – at least, as far as BC-based surf filmmaker Ben Gulliver and surf photographer Jeremy Koreski are concerned. 


ABOUT A NEW BREED
Times are changing, and a new breed of artists are closing the gap on their ambitions; relieved of obstacles that were hindering a decade ago. When a musician's Soundcloud uploads turn into a world tour, and a photographer's steady Instagram following evolves into an international campaign, it's clear to see that more than ever, being a creator is synonymous with being self-made.

One of the most satisfying things is a tire pattering down the trail, squashing muck, sliding over roots and smashing puddles. Unfortunately this lush, raw sound is often lost in most videos, overtaken by the music. Curtis Robinson takes advantage of winter conditions and makes some noise with his Stumpjumper FSR EVO.

1132,116498390,He Took His Skin Off For Me,"The story of a man who takes his skin off for his girlfriend, and why it probably wasn't the best idea...

BEHIND THE SCENES - https://vimeo.com/116467047

Please turn off the lights. Use headphones. Go full screen. It's worth it.

'He Took His Skin Off For Me' is a practical SFX fairytale. No CGI whatsoever. Based on the short story by Maria Hummer it is my grad film from the London Film School. It took myself and producer Fiona Lamptey 2 years, 217 Kickstarter backers and a whole lot of fake blood to pull off. SFX legend Colin Arthur (NeverEnding Story, 2001: A Space Odyssey) helped us achieve the impossible, allowing SFX Supervisor Jen Cardno and her team set a new standard for anatomical practical effects. Actor Sebastian Armesto (Anonymous, Pirates of the Caribbean) spent as long as 8hrs in makeup each day to bring this story to life. Alongside Anna Maguire (Saving Private Ryan, Parade's End) they both give us something wonderful, horrible and completely unique. I don’t want to tell people what the film should be. Even finding a genre to describe it is difficult. I want people to come to this film just like I came to the original story, completely unprepared.

If I can leave with one pearl of wisdom, though; if you take off your skin just to be with somebody? That’s only ever going to end messy…

1142,115476131,Litefeet,"Winner of the Neighborhood award at Lower East Side Film Festival 2015. 

With special thanks to Hannah Vasdekys and Nowness.

Scott Carthy’s debut film ‘Litefeet’ documents the recently criminalised art of subway dancing. The footage is of one of NYC’s most prolific dance groups, the W.A.F.F.L.E crew, leading up to their last dance on the improvised stage of a subway car. Carthy combines art with documentary for this sensitive, eye-wateringly clean-lined piece.

NY Police Commissioner, Bill Bratton implemented the law prohibiting performing on trains as an extension of the ‘Broken Windows theory’. The theory suggests that our environment can be a precursor to crime and violence if its upkeep is not carefully maintained. The NYPD argue that allowing ‘quality of life crimes’ such as open drug deals, graffiti art and prostitutes, sends out the message that more serious crimes are permissible. Carthy’s dancers have been slotted into this category now, becoming part of a clean up of the city which really began in the 90’s. 

However, the law does not acknowledge the significance of this subculture within the cultural heritage of NYC. Litefeet is a branch of street (dance) performance originating from the neighbourhoods of New York, Harlem and the Bronx. These iconic places once teemed with violence but what followed was unrivalled creativity which has been passed down through generations. The birth of Hip Hop, Break dancing and a myriad of other disciplines of dance are the fruit of the struggles people faced. Litefeet inherited a little from many of these styles, principally the Harlem Shake, Chicken Noodle Soup, Aunt Jackie and Tone Wop.

1146,114553695,NOVA,"Headphones recommended.

Nova is an experimental study of the visual arts technique slit scan with a particular focus on emphasising its spacial and temporal properties. The slit scan image is created using video footage of bioluminescent deep sea creatures, particularly Comb Jellyfish. These creatures acted as a source of inspiration for the form and animation. The resulting structure resembles a surreal organism that is locked into an ever-increasing state of perpetual growth, decay and transformation.

The structure is built and rendered in realtime and programmed in C++ using openFrameworks. More info here - http://www.jamesalliban.com/#/nova

Here is the popular electronic music artist, Giraffage.  The video chronicles the story of four dogs that long for benefits that a life as a human would bring them. Their wish is granted and their dreams seem to be fulfilled... until the reality sinks in that being a human isn't all it's cracked up to be.

Not known for its Big mountains, but more for rope tows, amazing snowboard parks and a snow blanketed urban landscape make this place one of a kind. Minnesota also has some awesome local shops, including Zombie, youth shelter supply, Damage, and cal surf. This place rules and if you get a chance to go hang there I strongly suggest it

The convivial tone veils the dystopian message of the narrative. Cranes, trains and automobiles instil a sense of constant industry – as the populous swells upwards, outwards, downwards and inwards – contorting and adapting – forcing the inhabitants to recast themselves.

UPDATE: For anyone interested I have made a clip with a few discarded scenes from this film, which can be seen here: https://vimeo.com/132183031
-----
Wanderers is a vision of humanity's expansion into the Solar System, based on scientific ideas and concepts of what our future in space might look like, if it ever happens. The locations depicted in the film are digital recreations of actual places in the Solar System, built from real photos and map data where available.
Without any apparent story, other than what you may fill in by yourself, the idea of the film is primarily to show a glimpse of the fantastic and beautiful nature that surrounds us on our neighboring worlds - and above all, how it might appear to us if we were there.

As some may notice I have borrowed ideas and concepts from science fiction authors such as Kim Stanley Robinson and Arthur C. Clarke, just to name a few. And visually, I of course owe many tips of my hat to painter Chesley Bonestell - the legendary master of space art.

More directly, with kind permission from Ann Druyan I have also borrowed the voice of astronomer and author Carl Sagan to narrate the film. The audio I used are excerpts from his own reading of his book 'Pale Blue Dot: A Vision of the Human Future in Space' (1994, Random House, http://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/159735/pale-blue-dot-by-carl-sagan/) - needless to say, a huge inspiration for this film.

Take a rare glimpse into the lives of the Assyrians and Yezidis after the ISIS attacks in Iraq.

""The Last Plight"" is a documentary about the humanitarian crisis in Iraq after the horrific terrorists attacks of the Islamic State (IS or ISIS) on Iraq's 2nd largest city Mosul and the Nineveh Plains.
Their latest attacks on June 10th 2014 forced more than 600,000 Assyrian Christians, Yazidis and other Iraqi minorities to seek refuge in the Northern region of Iraq.

The historical geopolitical conflict between the different players in Iraq let Iraq's minorities pay the biggest price.

The film explores the causes and solutions to this mass exodus.

1187,112491820,A battle for peace,"A soldier goes to the front during World War I, whose horrors make him realise that the enemy is actually war itself. 
The testimony of this soldier stands as a methaphor for the terrible cruelty of war and the desire for peace.



A battle for peace is part of the12 minutes about peace

One of the most imaginative projects to mark the centenary of the First World War is 12 Minutes About Peace, a collection of 12 one-minute animated shorts on the theme of peace. They were made by bothemerging as well as established talents in Flemish animation.

Peace was chosen as a theme in order to encourage contemporary perspectives and also to accentuate the positive, rather than focus exclusively on the negatives of war. Nevertheless, animators were allowed to address the theme in the way they wanted and with a free choice in form and technique. Films could benarrative or abstract, with or without dialogue, and draw on the widest range of animation styles. However, each film could only be one minute in length.

1194,111049676,Astronaut - A journey to space,"What does astronaut see from up there? From the red soil of africa, the blue water of oceans, to the green lights of the poles and yellow light of human activity, discover, throught this journey to space, something astoundingly beautiful and strange at the same time.

I wanted to do something different from what has been done before with those shots. Something more dynamic and fast. After all, ISS travel through space at 28.000km/h! There are also more recent footage that have never been used (at least I think...) in other edits.

All the credit goes to the crew members of ISS expeditions 28, 29, 30, 31, 34, shot from 2011 to 2014.
The international Space Station weigh 377 tons, orbits the earth at around 350km from the surface, and does one spin around the earth in 1h30, at 28.000k/h! At 1'11 we can see a little refueling shuttle desintegrating back to earth. At 1'20, it's an Orbital Science's Cygnus Orb-2 spacecraft that is launched into orbit. The little green and purple lights you can see at 1'57 are respectively fishing boats and oil platforms offshore with the big city of Bangkok nearby.

All the footage (around 80GB of pictures) was processed throught after effects/premiere, denoised for some shots, removal of dead pixels for some shots, deflickering, and simple color grading (didnt want to change the already incredible look! just curves, saturation, and some blue crushing). Don't hesitate to comment and ask questions about the video!

This film is part of the ongoing ‘Reely and Truly’ project which will culminate in a book of photographs, texts and films about the practice of over 30 contemporary photographers to be published by DoBeDo in 2015. This 30 minute film is an extended trailer for that project.

Watch In Damascus VFX Breakdown and read the description for  technical Information about the film on this link :
www.vimeo.com/waref/indamasvfx

This film is about Damascus, an 11,000 years old city, the most ancient & precious of cities, set to the poetry of the world famous Palestinian poet / author Mahmoud Darwish.

More than three years have passed since the idea inception up to this moment. This project was my companion during my staying abroad, it was like a friend and an enemy at the same time, sometimes I spend hours working on it, and sometimes I leave it for months.
Now after two months of heavy work, I've finished it, and I would like to present it to you … I hope you like it.

الفيلم يتكلم عن مدينة دمشق, مدينة يعود عمرها إلى أكثر من 11 ألف سنة, يرافق الفيلم مقاطع من قصيدة ""طوق الحمامة الدمشقي""  من تأليف وإلقاء الشاعر الفلسطيني المعروف محمود درويش 

أكثر من ثلاث سنوات مرّت منذ انطلاق الفكرة إلى هذه اللحظة. كان هذا المشروع رفيقي في الغربة, لقد كان بمثابة العدو والصديق بالنسبة لي فأحيانا اشتاق للعمل عليه فامضي الساعات هناك وأحيانا أكرهه لدرجة تركه بالشهور.
بعد أكثر من شهرين من العمل المكثف, ولله الحمد, انتهيت من العمل عليه, وأنا اقدمه اليوم بين أيديكم هدية ... اتمنى أن تنال إعجابكم.

Word from the director:
So excited to share this with you! I am also proud to feature a song i produced with my dad, Damon Frost as the main theme in this film. Ready to Surrender is a force to reckon with, do it justice by turning up the volume on your system or plug in your good headphones. Enjoy!

Ten months later, our work is being projected over three massive screens, illustrating over 40 background settings and dark inner-workings of the main character in a 2-hour long stage performance called Stickboy. You can see it live in Vancouver until November 7, 2014 (visit vancouveropera.ca for more info).

1234,108499003,Desire To Fly - Samantha Bryan,"Samantha Bryan is a mixed-media artist based in West Yorkshire. She works from a studio in the West Yorkshire Print Workshop situated in Mirfield.

Samantha finds herself preoccupied with everyday life, but not her own- that of the fairy. Consequently her sculptures place what can only be described as ‘fairies’ with machine-like contraptions. They depict fairies going about their everyday lives. Within her work her extraordinary objective is to realise the necessities and requirements that would be involved in ‘fairy life’: to provide everything a fairy would demand during its daily existence.

1238,108494448,i was a skate rat.,"i was a skate rat.

The sun drenched, cascade of sub and ex-urban cul-de-sacs crawl across the state of Florida, much like its creeping kudzu brethren to the north. A constant source of derision among urban planning futurists, architects, and environmentalists alike, the vague banality of suburban life has been excoriated for years by the culture class for representing the life draining, and waste producing by-product of our civilization’s greatest advances. Skateboarding, like life, as is so menacingly projected in 1993’s Jurassic Park, will find a way. It is in these island-like colonies, without the music scenes, without advantageous architectural density, and without the crews of peers that drove skating to new heights in urban environments, that some of skateboarding’s most pivotal moments transpired.

I was a Skate Rat, is a brief meditation on the nature of how suburban nomadic skateboarders find each other, build communities - and as is often the case in adversarial environments - use every inch of their limitations and blank canvas, to breed ideas that influence the life of skateboarders every day. From the kick flip, to the kick tail, Floridians are responsible for scores of technical and cultural advancements - and they are all skate rats.

Based on Exodus 12:
21 Then Moses called for all the elders of Israel, and said unto them, Draw out and take you a lamb according to your families, and kill the passover.
22 And ye shall take a bunch of hyssop, and dip it in the blood that is in the bason, and strike the lintel and the two side posts with the blood that is in the bason; and none of you shall go out at the door of his house until the morning.
23 For the Lord will pass through to smite the Egyptians; and when he seeth the blood upon the lintel, and on the two side posts, the Lord will pass over the door, and will not suffer the destroyer to come in unto your houses to smite you.
24 And ye shall observe this thing for an ordinance to thee and to thy sons for ever.
25 And it shall come to pass, when ye be come to the land which the Lord will give you, according as he hath promised, that ye shall keep this service.
26 And it shall come to pass, when your children shall say unto you, What mean ye by this service?
27 That ye shall say, It is the sacrifice of the Lord's passover, who passed over the houses of the children of Israel in Egypt, when he smote the Egyptians, and delivered our houses. And the people bowed the head and worshipped.
28 And the children of Israel went away, and did as the Lord had commanded Moses and Aaron, so did they.
29 And it came to pass, that at midnight the Lord smote all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, from the firstborn of Pharaoh that sat on his throne unto the firstborn of the captive that was in the dungeon; and all the firstborn of cattle.
30 And Pharaoh rose up in the night, he, and all his servants, and all the Egyptians; and there was a great cry in Egypt; for there was not a house where there was not one dead.

LYRICS by David King, aka Duke of Uke:

DEATH: Falling stars you wished upon
are cinders now and now they're gone
their residue festoons my fetid field.
Unfeeling husks of lovers past
the shells are all that ever last
I've taken everything that they concealed.
Whoever told you life was fair?
Look around you, everywhere
the cruelty of nature is displayed!
Why the scorn?
Why the surprise?
Everything that's born must die
and it isn't I who made the world that way.

What wicked little twist of fate
placed you here upon my plate
Here, where no one hears your cries?
Where was your god to steer you through
Perhaps your god's forsaken you
Otherwise why lead you here to die?

BA (spirit of the dead): I, I know the way how
I'll melt away now
I know the way.
I'm feeling bliss now
Dissolved to mist how
strangely I go
away
Now I finally know

DEATH: It's merely moments now,
moments now until
your feeble flesh bends to my will
and it will
so rest your weary head.
There'll be no pain,
no pain at all
as everything you are dissolves
Your fate resolved
upon my silky thread.

BA: I, I know the way how
I'll melt away now
I know the way.
I'm feeling bliss now
Dissolved to mist how
strangely I go
away
Now I finally know

Hello! My name is Dima, I am CG enthusiast from Russia. This is cartoon parable. Despite the fact that mankind is killed, the war still continues. War continued with automated system left by people. One of the last surviving bomber and its pilot still performs its task. The city is dead for a long time. Dead people who built it. Dead people who gave the order to destroy the city. And war will continue until subside echo of humanity.But life will always find a way to survive. Cassette bomb submunitions became a fortress for the grass.

1268,106420288,Tycho – See (Official Performance Cut),"Upon releasing the Music Video for Tycho’s track ‘See’ on Ghostly International, we decided a special release of the Performance Cut was worthy of public consumption, ultimately editing a montage of the entire band performance using only Kinect-informed, infrared footage with practical selects dappled amongst the 5 minutes for visual reprieve.. The result is a journey into the band’s aural landscape, immersing the eyes in a sea of bokeh where the instruments and performers melt into a performance charged with circular aberrations of light and color..

THE FILM TECHNIQUE

We started experimenting with infrared lighting and discovered that the IR emitter in the Microsoft Kinect projected a starfield-like dot pattern not unlike what a 3D render of point cloud data looks like.. Captured with our full spectrum camera it became photographic, where fields of bokeh and shimmering discs reveal multiple layers of shape and form.. In addition, some of the lens flares we were able to make with the Kinect are unlike anything we've ever seen before - creating super dense moire patterns and 3D-like caustic inversions of lens geometry. 

The set in which we shot the Performance was totally dark, aside from a red laser as our backdrop - we could not see anything except while looking through the cameras viewfinder. Operating a camera in this situation was like a real manifestation of virtual reality. The band also couldn’t see each other and couldn’t tell who or what the camera was looking at - which ultimately made the performance feel very raw and unhindered.. The visual results tie perfectly with the concept of ’See’ in which we always seem to reveal new worlds that are beyond our terrestrial abilities of sight..

He also learnt to follow my hand as I moved it around the outside of his tank. The Abovemarine is a vehicle that enables José to roam on the land. This small freedom allows him to Interact with other species including humans and small animals. José is able to navigate around a room, as he swims backwards (stopping the Abovemarine) before hitting obstacles. 

There is a popular myth about fish, that they have a 3 second memory. I wonder whether the stories that we tell about other species say more about ourselves that they do about the other. Animal behavioural researchers for example design experiments to measure intelligence in other species. I imagine these rather as experiments of our own intelligence. Are we intelligent enough to design an experiment that proves the intelligence of the other to ourselves?",2014-09-01T03:13:08-04:00,165167718,128,106547345,78,252414,3950,https://i.vimeocdn.com/video/489705756_780x439.webp
1273,105570864,Glass Blowing | Jeremy Maxwell Wintrebert  (Heart of Glass Documentary preamble),"French subtitled version/version française sous-titrée: https://vimeo.com/106829226
 This film is the preamble of the documentary Heart of Glass. 
Heart of Glass is a journey. A road trip through several countries on two continents in pursuit of a story. 
The story of a young glass blower with a singular talent: Jeremy Maxwell Wintrebert. 
The film follows him in his daily life--working in the studio and on the road. 
Jeremy recounts growing up in Africa, where he drew inspiration for his first pieces. He speaks of his family of Franco-American origin, difficult events he faced, the challenges of returning to Europe. He speaks of his first encounter with glass at age 19. The first time he saw the hot glass moving at the end of a blow pipe was his seminal moment. The way the glass, fluid, delicate and mysterious, danced that day has forever changed him. 
The film reveals how passion can undo a tragic fate.

Feel free to help the project with the Tip Jar ! :)

1275,106167333,I HAVE BEEN TO THE MOUNTAINTOP,"I am in no way even attempting to assume that I know anything about the political/social realities at play in the world at the moment, but at quick glance it seems as though violence breeds more violence. The people who changed the world, were the ones who laid down their arms - chose to forgive - to restore - to love - people like Jesus, Mandela, Gandhi, Martin Luther King. 

Just before he was assassinated on April 3rd, 1968, Martin Luther King preached the sermon ‘I’ve been to the Mountaintop’. Its a profound account of hope, amidst despair - where he considers the significance of being born into the turmoil and unrest of the twentieth century. His outlook provides unique context for pain and suffering as he says ‘only when it is dark enough can you see the stars’.

He goes on to say; ‘Men for years now have been talking about war and peace. But now no longer can they just talk about it. It is no longer a choice between violence and nonviolence in this world; it’s nonviolence or nonexistence. That is where we are today.’

He modeled a way of non-violence - and it cost him his life. 

Inspired by his words one night I cut together this clip using old archive footage from the Prelinger Archives - those words are as poignant today as they were back when he first spoke them - if not more (for me personally at least).

1284,105551999,Howard's Farm,"AUG, 2015 UPDATE: Howard was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer this past April and I got the sad news yesterday that he passed away in his Marlboro, NY farmhouse, in care of his loving family and community. 

I’ll remember Howard for his warmth, wisdom, and strong work ethic. I’ll especially miss his sharp wits and sense of humor, his simple yet profound anecdotes (“sitting is the new smoking”), and his zenlike equanimity. 

I feel so grateful to have grown up and spent time with Howard and his family, and for being able to spend time with him last August to capture his story.

1302,103092939,Warbird Pilot: Behind the Visor,"Some people see pilots as fearless, confident, arrogant, but they are no different than you or me, just willing to put it all on the line to keep our warbirds legacy alive at their own personal sacrifice.

This mini doc. is to show what it’s like to be a warbird pilot. These guys are keeping our history alive by flying and maintaining these legacy aircraft for future generations. Some of these guys were born into the life style, while others that have worked their way into the small community. Most pilots come off as fearless, confident, and sometimes arrogant but there is a reason for this. Fear can get you killed up in the air but confidence can get you home safely! We explore the aspects of flying these birds, the bad/difficult parts, the passion behind it/why they do it, the tragedies, the joys and the fears of this life style. John-Curtiss Paul talks about the life of maintaining and flying the old birds but also the life he potential leaves behind with each flight. There are only a handful of people in the world that are even capable of doing what John-Curtiss Paul does.

Most of this project was filmed on the FS100 but we also use a 7D, 60D, and Go-pro Footage. The FS100 was the A cam; we did not have a ton of lenses to work with...mainly the 18-200mm Sony E-mount and a 20mm Sony E-mount 2.8 which worked great for fast shooting. The trick for us was making good use of the Tiffen ND filters. We shot all the interviews at 24p and most of the Broll in 60p (S & Q). There were a few times I change to 1080 60p internal to the cam because I wanted to capture audio that I could use later in post but also want to slow it down to 24p. The 7D, which was our B cam also had a stock lens, the 18-135mm Canon EF. This was also the cam we used for the time-lapse shots. We had to be scrappy when making this project which was actually really fun. The project was finished up and edited in Premiere Pro CC.",2014-08-10T21:15:54-04:00,1250600094,626,104507683,73,518573,3748,https://i.vimeocdn.com/video/487321975_780x439.webp

1305,103678910,‘Am I Next?': Ferguson’s Protests Through the Eyes of a Teenager,"Looting, chanting, tear gas, rubber bullets – these are the images from Ferguson, Mo. entering American homes. But the vast majority of protesters are armed with little more than chalk and paper signs, hoping to create a memorial for Michael Brown, the teenager killed by a police officer in the St Louis suburb on Aug. 9. We followed teenager Shane Flowers as he weaved through the protests, attempting to let his voice be heard and fight for change with darkness slowly falling on Florissant Avenue. As he moves through the crowds, he hears differing opinions from other protesters on the best ways to fight for change.

1312,95946394,IRMA / Save me,"Deux ans après sa révélation sur Youtube, la chanteuse Camerounaise Irma, du label My Major Company, sort son second album « Faces ». Superbien assure la Direction Artistique et le Vidéomapping du clip « Save Me » produit par HK Corp.

Dans ce poème visuel, Irma nous transporte entre différents univers plus oniriques les uns que les autres. La chanteuse, accompagnée de petites danseuses et de musiciens, exécute une chorégraphie en accord parfait avec le contenu des images projetées par sept vidéoprojecteurs dans une boite blanche. Superbien relève le défi de tourner ce clip en un plan séquence ou tout le contenu vidéo est projeté en compensation optique en fonction du point de vue de la caméra, plongeant ainsi le spectateur dans une véritable oeuvre immersive.


Two years after being revealed on Youtube, Cameroonian singer Irma released her second album ""Faces"". 
On the song ""Save me"" Superbien was Artistic Director and created a videomapping clip. In this visual poem, the singer, accompanied by young dancers and by musicians, performs a choreography perfectly in sync with the videomapping content, diffused by seven projectors in a white box. 
Superbiens challenge was to film this video in sequence shot, while the content was projected by optical compensation (ie. depending on the point of view of the camera) so as to immerse the viewer into the video.

1319,102051605,Enter Pyongyang,"“Enter Pyongyang” is another stunning collaboration between city-­diplomacy pioneer JT Singh and flow-motion videographer Rob Whitworth. Blending time-lapse photography, acceleration and slow motion, HD and digital animation, they have produced a cutting‐edge panorama of a city hardly known, but one emerging on the visitor’s landscape as North Korea’s opening unfolds.

North Korea was the last country seemingly immune to change—but no longer. Recent years have witnessed mobile phone penetration, a surge in tourists, and even a marathon. Numerous special economic zones have been launched in cooperation with China, Russia, and South Korea, with railways planned linking all countries in the region. “Enter Pyongyang” captures not just the city, but this dynamism and sense of potential.

This video is the single most significant multi-­media contribution to transcending clichés about North Korea as a society defined by reclusiveness and destitution. To travel there is to witness a proud civilization, though one caught in a Cold War time-warp. Korean cultural traditions are meticulously preserved and displayed in authentic richness. Anyone who has witnessed the awe-inspiring Mass Games knows that, with great sacrifice, North Koreans can pull off a performance unparalleled in its precision.

“Enter Pyongyang” captures the reality of North Korean citizens as earnest and humane, not automatons. The infamous traffic ladies and subway guards stand stiff and sentinel—but today they share a smile too. The more North Koreans one meets, the more one sees an organic society that wants to be a normal country. If you travel there not to judge but to appreciate, you will come away with a better understanding of how challenging national transformation can be. 

""Enter Pyongyang"" is above all an invitation to explore. Few places in the world have been as hermetically sealed as North Korea, but Koryo Tours has made it possible not just to see North Korea but to engage with it in ways that were impossible until very recently. This is a window of opportunity not to be missed. If Pyongyang is no longer off limits, no place is.

--Foreword by Dr. Parag Khanna, Director, Hybrid Reality


Koryo Group: The Koryo team brought a wealth of valuable knowledge and expertise to this project. Thanks to their extensive experience in running tourism and cultural engagement projects in North Korea since 1993, we were able to get unprecedented access in Pyongyang. We are thankful to the Koryo team and their Korean partners for an unforgettable experience.

FAQs

-How were you guys allowed to film in Pyongyang?

This project was produced in conjunction with Koryo Tours, the leading North Korea travel specialist. Co-producer Vicky Mohieddeen of Koryo Tours was with us throughout the shoot.

-Were there restrictions on what was allowed to be filmed?

We were closely assisted by two guides from the National Tourism Administration, who helped us gain special access to locations and made sure that we followed all the rules. As is standard for all foreign visitors to the country, we were not allowed to shoot any construction sites, undeveloped locations or military personnel. Other than that we were given relatively free reign.

-Isn’t this all fake? You don’t see the real North Korea.

The average visitor to Pyongyang is likely to be surprised by the scenes they encounter and are especially surprised about how clean and orderly the city actually is. Indeed, people living in Pyongyang and other major cities enjoy a higher quality of life than those in other parts of the country.

-Are people allowed to travel to North Korea?

Yes, despite what the majority of people think, it is possible to visit North Korea as a tourist. North Korea does not release official data on the number of Western tourists it receives, but estimates range from 4,000 to 6,000 per year. Most of the foreign tourists are from Mainland China, estimated in the tens of thousands annually.

-Were you paid to make this film?

We volunteered for this project with no pay at all. All other travel expenses for the 6 day trip were covered by Koryo Tours.

-Does this film support the DPRK government?

""Enter Pyongyang"" is an observational film. At no point did Koryo Tours or we have to pretend to be supporters of the DPRK Government or their philosophy in order to be granted permission to shoot this film. Amazingly, we were given complete editorial control in the making of this piece.

“The Temple rises apart from Black Rock City, an oasis of calm out in the deep playa that stands resolute, able to bear what participants bring and to be what we need at the moment we call on it.

Behind the Temple stands a group that has quietly watched over those structures each year since 2002. The main duty of the Temple Guardians is to protect the Temple and those who visit it. We abide with love for the Temple and everything that it represents.” – The Temple Guardians

1344,98970817,THE SPACE WITHIN,"The medium of Ajay Malghan’s photography is food but—hold up, hold up—we know that your Instagram feed is filled with filtered images of half-eaten falafel sandwiches and spicy tuna rolls. We understand, we do, and we feel for you. But Malghan’s photography explores the myriad worlds of food’s complexity hiding just beyond its seeming simplicity. For instance, an orange. Everyone knows what an orange looks like, right? But Malghan's lens toys with the orange until the orange is not an orange but, rather, a curious image of playful ambiguity. There are many people dancing. Wildfires. And all the things that only you will see.

1346,101238565,The Story of a Story,"The Story of a Story is an attempt to translate the love and effort we put into every film we make.
The idea came while we were talking about how hard it can be for outsiders to understand the workflow behind what we do. 

It can all seem a bit too magical and otherworldly (because in a way it is), but it’s also a damn serious process. 
We wanted to explain how each step leads to another in the twist of a story and have fun with loads of different animation techniques.

An ode to our own job, ‘cause that’s how much we love it!

I've often wondered why do I act unlike my friends, why do I feel one way and not the other.
When I looked retrospectively inward, I saw that: 
a person is a messy  construct of previous character transformations, while a character is designed by it's surrounding to survive and succeed in it.

It was the change that no-one saw coming: the idea that we could take a book, a painting or a song and send it through cables and wires and even thin air to the other end of the world - and it would be identical on the other side. But this idea underpins everything about the Information Age we live in.

How did we make such a mind bending transition into the digital world? And how does it work? It turns out it's all based on a concept that is surprisingly beautiful in its simplicity. This short video essay explores what that idea is and tells you about the man who figured it all out.

Computers are everywhere and control almost every aspect of our lives. In the next 6 minutes you'll find out how they really work.

Story:

“This is the way the world ends
Not with a bang but a whimper.” - TS ELLIOTT

Transience reflects the condition of every being in the universe seen through a sensitive, intellectual or even felt experience.
Even further, what humanity can’t describe, touch or identify is also linked to the same vanishing flow.
As big can be atoms or minuscule the stars, it’s all about sequences, pace, sudden apparitions or slow decay.
Humanity seems to have a unique potential in this constant struggle between life and entropy.
Whether our aptitudes help us prevail and evolve or instead accelerates our doom we have yet to decide.
That hesitation would come to an end with self-annihilation, but an end may just be a transition, a transformation.


Process:

Structured in a pseudo-timeline, the film is visually bringing a balance of positive and negative aspects in humanity. Slow or fast paced scenes, soft nature or hard concrete environments are shown as global human experience.
Initially a personal practice to bring mental concepts to life, this movie is achieved by two individuals, Julien Vanhoenacker as writer/director/VFX artist and Nicolas Vitte as music composer.
A great deal of computing power is needed to generate CGI images and the availability of the renderfarm of The Post Bangkok is a chance that allows this film to exist.
Creating these visual metaphors is a lengthy process spanning over many months. This allows ideas to be refined and become stronger in time, but also requires organisation, endurance and perfectionism, as well as the ability to stay focused on the initial intention.

RAEN is the first creation from Carlo & Dante Mondavi. The Mondavi legacy has spread outward from Napa Valley for more than a century. Carlo and Dante strive to explore and to find their own path in the creation of their own wine while testing the rules and boundaries of their childhood.

This was shot on my holiday (yes my passion is also my job!) alongside some stuff for my GH4 review. Koh Yao Noi is one of the least developed islands in Thailand despite being right in the middle of the most touristic bay there. It's a little haven of real Thailand with just 18km of roads.

Dialogue list:

I’m scared, I don’t dare look ahead
This isn’t a time to lie
I wouldn’t dare close my eyes, if I could
At this moment in time my whole body is listening.
Please forgive me. Please don’t hang up the phone.
Hold the rope tight and string us together
Relax a bit, buddy, I’m talking to myself
I can hear water. Are you grinding your teeth?

I’ll write you a letter. I’m harnessing in 
My lips are torn and the hawks are eyeing me
We might as well do it now. life dangles by a thread of time
If the next flight is successful, seize the sky

I want to dance, I’m suddenly happy
I can feel my whole body shaking
I’m not scared at all, I’ve become a dot
I’ve become a button on a shirt, living there eternally

I’m scared, I don’t dare look ahead
This isn’t a time to lie
I wouldn’t dare close my eyes, if I could
At this moment in time my whole body is listening.
Yesterday morning I decided to put on my shoes
A minute ago I looked up and it became truthful
Everything’s safe, serene as a rain shower
My heart’s in my mouth, how can I say I love you

I need a comb to put under the sole of my shoe
I need a sole to separate myself from the world
A village, a café, some beer, and a fish
Get a suitcase, lock it up, and put it here

I’ll leave every comma there
That’s a road, the rhythm is in my back pocket
I’ll write you a letter

I definitely knew Shepard's work, whether it be that repetitive face of Andre the Giant popping up at every street corner I've ever been on, or as the Obama Poster that definitely did more for an election than just add aesthetic to it - but I was not aware at how incredibly inspiring Shepard would turn out to be.

Edmond is not like everybody else. A small, quiet man, Edmond has a wife who loves him and a job that he does extraordinarily well. He is, however, very aware that he is different.

And though he comes to enjoy his new identity, an ever-widening chasm opens up between himself and others.

1414,62386108,The Garden of Steven,"Steven Crosby, a small town missionary in a strange land stumbles upon the lowest road to salvation with the help of a little Mayan girl, a black magic woman, and a saint with a cigar.

SYNOPSIS
Steven Crosby wakes up in Antigua, Guatemala with a mission: to convert as many locals as he can, armed with only some religious comic books and a couple words of high school Spanish. If he fails, his father, a preacher, will make Steven pack his things and return to Ohio to a life of menial work in the church. His attempts to bring the locals the good news are thwarted by comic misunderstanding, bad luck, and all manner of mishaps. Just as Steven is about to give up, he has a chance encounter with a sodden street vendor, who puts him on a journey to find a shadowy figure named Maximon—a mix of a Mayan God and a Catholic Saint, and the patron of sinners, prostitutes, and drunks. Steven meets a plucky little Mayan girl and a beautiful bartender who help Steven find Maximon, and himself, along the way. With their help, Steven takes the low road to unique brand of salvation.

1427,88372148,A Subjective Story Of An Object,"“The object is influenced by its environment. The object is part of a reality. How we view the object depends on our perception of it and the materiality of the thing itself; these exist as two overlapping planes of thought - subjectivity and objectivity clash over and over. An exact composition of color, sound and language become contextually aware to create a dialogue between what we choose to see and what we understand.”

1437,94936857,Breathing Underwater,"I built my house by the sea. Not on the sands, mind you; not on the shifting sand. And I built it of rock. A strong house by a strong sea. And we got well acquainted, the sea and I. Good neighbors. Not that we spoke much.
We met in silences. Respectful, keeping our distance, but looking our thoughts across the fence of sand.
Always, the fence of sand our barrier, always, the sand between. And then one day, and I still don’t know how it happened - the sea came. Without warning. Without welcome, even. Not sudden and swift, but a shifting across the sand like wine, less like the flow of water than the flow of blood. Slow, but coming. Slow, but flowing like an open wound. And I thought of flight and I thought of drowning and I thought of death. And while I thought the sea crept higher, till it reached my door. And I knew, then, there was neither flight, nor death, nor drowning. That when the sea comes calling, you stop being neighbors, Well acquainted, friendly-at-a-distance neighbors, And you give your house for a coral castle, And you learn to breathe underwater.

1445,92826333,#BRIDGETHEGAP - THE STORY,"Some only come out at night. Some never stepped foot on a track. Some never defined themselves as athletes. Yet all are inspired by a common philosophy and by the idea of using the pavements of their urban wildlife as their playground. From New York City to Moscow, from London to Zurich - they are all inspired by each other. They are unified by a responsibility to make each other improve, in the pursuit of accomplishing the unthinkable. These are the times when you share joy as much as you share pain, and you grow into a team inseparable.

1447,94202204,Mother's Song,"My new class giving a peak at my creative process! skl.sh/matty

There is a woman who walks through the streets randomly singing opera. Wherever she goes she is singing, sometimes under her breath, sometimes loud enough for whole blocks to hear. Some people think she is deranged, some think she is inspiring. I was compelled to sit down with her and have a short conversation about Why. I only had an hour and a half with her, but she struck a cord enough that made me buy a ticket to go see my mom, heh. I decided that I would put this online and hope to inspire people to go embrace their mothers and children. She's also a very prime example of why not to judge people by their eccentricities.

1456,28735477,"Sims ""LMG""","Official music video for ""LMG"" by SIMS,  Doomtree Records 2010

Directed and Animated by Matt Scharenbroich

www.mattscharenbroich.com









The third single off of Bad Time Zoo, released earlier this year, showcases SIMS in a new way, animated. SIMS explains how the video came to be by saying, “I usually have decent ideas when it comes to conceptualizing music videos, but this one was a challenge. The song itself is borderline cheesy as is, which is why Beak and I love it. We knew the video couldn’t be too cutsie and could absolutely not take place in a bar. After those parameters, we were out of ideas so we enlisted the services of Matt Scharenbroich, a really talented visual artist and the drummer in Beak's old band TPC.

Created in director Scharenbroich’s studio over the course of an icy winter in Minneapolis the “LMG” video is the end result of more than 1600 individual drawings, 400 cups of coffee, 60 markers and two ecstatic hands. The video was made using a technique called rotoscoping, which is “the tracing of live-action film frames in order to capture a more realistic movement. It has an immediate kinetic energy that results from the inevitable variation of the tactile mediums used throughout. Markers smear and fade, graphite scratches into the page, and ephemeral, singular ideas punctuate single frames in the rhythm of the process.” Sounds simple right?

The video highlights the contrast between the confessional, dark narrative of the verses and the overjoyed, positive message of the chorus. The diaristic song felt sincere and energetic, and rotoscoping “captures SIMS’ performance and catapults it into another more joyful sphere where fingers transform into bottle rockets and fireworks emerge from palms.”

Ladybug and the wolf is one of the current music scene revelations in rhone alpes. Their last record ""to raise a miniature garden gave them the opportunity to be discovered by professionals nation-wide.
An extensive music work and a real freshness emerge from their image.
Through their sincerity and the perfect harmony of their voices, many people see in the band the potential successors of Folk  music made in France.

All of history's greatest figures achieved success in almost exactly the same way. But rather than celebrating this part of the creative process we ignore it. 

This missing chapter in the story of success reveals the secret to doing meaningful work. But in the modern world, full of distraction, do we have what it takes to do great things?

The second in a three-part series about creativity.

Director of Photography - David Ehrenreich
Music - Brennan Lloyd
Sound Design - Nate Evans

Salvation Mountain is known around the world as a burst of color in the desert outside Niland, California, on the Mexican border. A one-man monument built over three decades piece by piece; it is a gradual accruement of hope, love and joy in physical form.

Less is known about the man who built it, Leonard Knight, mostly because that's the way he liked it. An unassuming man, he preferred to let his mountain speak for itself. It did just that, in bright, bold colors and optimistic messages.

After visiting the mountain multiple times, filmmakers Ben Stoddard and Dave Ehrenreich spent an intimate extended stay with Leonard at Salvation Mountain. Rather than add to the already vast lexicon on the mountain as an object, they chose to focus their attention on the man who built it. Through interviews with Leonard and his inner circle of friends that cared for him in his fading years, they hoped to learn about and showcase the enigmatic artist himself.

EUROPE IN 8 BITS is a documentary of 76 min. directed by Javier Polo that explores the world of chip music, a new musical trend that is growing exponentially throughout Europe. The stars of this musical movement reveal to us how to reuse old videogames hardware like Nintendo’s GameBoy, NES, Atari ST, Amiga and the Commodore 64 to turn them into a tool capable of creating a new sound, a modern tempo and an innovative musical style. This is a new way of interpreting music performed by a great many artists who show their skills in turning these “limited” machines designed for leisure in the 80’s into surprising musical instruments and graphical tools. It will leave nobody indifferent.

THE CONCEPT OF BUTTERFLY HOUSE
When I was just a kid, I´ve been painting some butterfly in a nice way, the method consist in draw just in one side of the paper then close the both sides to have a mirrored image. The most common image was a butterfly. 

This thing keep in my mind until these days. I ever think about create some new architecture using this mirror idea to create a new image. A lot of  kind of solutions passed through my mind but I never did, until now.

I was really really tired to see the same kind of 3D architectural images: Box house on middle of trees or just lofts with same furniture. So I mixed this two problems and thought in a solution., using the butterfly main idea. It was just think ""outside the box"".

95% of the models was made by myself and the other 5% are premade models.",2013-03-14T16:28:08-04:00,88501714,95,86519824,30,194041,1104,https://i.vimeocdn.com/video/464242355_780x439.webp

Eye of the Storm is a winter saga in Iceland. In Iceland there are many kinds of storms. Ice, snow, rain, sand, ash, solar, magnetic, and more. 

Storms are agents of change. While often destructive and unpredictable, they also demonstrate the unyielding power of nature. They reveal nature's beauty and its hand in creating the landscapes we see today. 

Shot in Iceland between February and March, 2014, I was lucky enough to witness and film the power of an X-class solar flare and coronal mass ejection hitting our atmosphere. The resulting auroras were a sight hard to believe, even in person and seeing it with my very own eyes. Enjoy the film!

1490,89216531,The World Beyond the World,"Using text adapted from Robert Marshalls ""Alaska Wilderness: Exploring the Brooks Range"" (1929) and images from Expedition Arguk (2013), ""The World Beyond the World"" aims to celebrate that most ancient and sublime of human pleasures: moving through a mysterious, beautiful, and unknown landscape.

In 2013, Expedition Arguk walked and packrafted across 300 miles of wilderness in the Alaska Arctic in order to report on Arctic issues and create public-use media from this far-off but increasingly important region. ""The World Beyond the World"" was shot during the first third of our trip, which took place entirely in Gates of the Arctic National Park and Preserve. Gates of the Arctic is the second-largest US National Park, but its extraordinary remoteness and challenging weather mean that the Park sees relatively few visitors. There are no guidebooks, trails, campgrounds, or roads. Most of the photos that make up this film are available for 100% free, unrestricted public use at www.expeditionarguk.com

Assembled entirely from stills shot with a Nikon D7100 camera, using a Nikon 55-200 VR and a Tokina 11-17 ultrawide lens. Post-production in Photoshop and After Effects, with countless hours on a Wacom Intuos4 tablet.

We are immensely grateful to the American Alpine Club, the Sierra Club Alaska Chapter, the Alaska Wilderness League, Ground Truth Trekking and our many other sponsors and advisors.

Additional thanks to our volunteer translators: Christopher, Pedro, and Anders.

1508,89203931,CRUSH,"""CRUSH"" is my final project of the 3D Animation and Visual Effects program in Vancouver Film School.

I had a lot of fun doing this. I was inspired by almost everything I saw, heard and felt for the past year (2013).

In ""Crush"", a pair of dummies are being assembled for a crash test. 
Moments before the test begins, a fateful spark alters the process. 
This event ignites a connection between the couple, driving them to defy their destination.

I used the VW Scirocco model from HDModels Cars vol. 3 by Evermotion.
For the rest of the visual elements,
I used Maya 2013 for modeling, shading, rigging and animation. 
I used Ncloth and particle system for the glass.
Mental Ray for lighting and rendering.

SPARROW is struck by a plane and lands wounded in a mysterious city inhabited by anthropomorphised birds.

With the chaos of urban life all around him, Sparrow goes on a heady journey of self-discovery and is faced with a choice: should he follow his natural instinct and flee, or adapt his nature and embrace city life.

This animated short with its distinctive illustrative style is a seductively immersive experience about our unnatural love affair with the city. A film for anyone who has ever lost him or herself.

Our Drone Future explores the technology, capability, and purpose of drones, as their presence becomes an increasingly pervasive reality in the skies of tomorrow. 

In the near future, cities use semi-autonomous drones for urban security. Human officers monitor drone feeds remotely, and data reports are displayed with a detailed HUD and communicated via a simulated human voice (designed to mitigate discomfort with sentient drone technology). While the drones operate independently, they are ""guided"" by the human monitors, who can suggest alternate mission plans and ask questions.  

Specializing in predictive analysis, the security drones can retask themselves to investigate potential threats. As shown in this video, an urban security drone surveys San Francisco's landmarks and encounters fierce civilian resistance.",2014-01-07T21:05:25-05:00,317857082,178,87916326,105,507797,2366,https://i.vimeocdn.com/video/466396941_780x439.webp

A video remix journey through the history of sampling taking in some of the most noted breaks and riffs of the decades. A chronological journey from the Beatles’ use of the Mellotron in the 60s to the sample dense hiphop and dance music of the 80s and 90s. Each break is represented by a vibrating vinyl soundwave exploding into various tracks that sampled it, each re-use another chapter in the modern narrative.

The project was developed for the 'Future Perfect' exhibition as part of the 2013 Architecture Triennale in Lisbon, Portugal and was presented by DAZED as part of the Visionaries series.

SYNOPSIS
In a near future heavily influenced by the imminent boom of the Indian subcontinent, an emerging technology and economic superpower a new digital city has developed. The film follows a group of young children as they play a game of hide and seek (Chupan Chupai) in the bustling streets of this smart city. Through their play the children discover how to hack the city, opening up a cavernous network of hidden and forgotten spaces, behind the scenes of everyday streets.

The narrative of piece focuses on how the children interact with their built environment, we explore the smart city through the device of the classic children's game. The design of the future city fuses technology and built matter as one programmable environment. Using gestures and signs as a language, the project takes the concept of gesture based control to the level where we can interact and control all elements of the built environment, creating a symbiosis between technology and the city. The film splits the physical architecture of the city into two categories; the synthesised lived in city, and its organic wild undergrowth.

The project was shot on location in India and uses a mixture of animation and visual effects to embellish the design of the city and locations that are pictured.

1564,85085976,Annette Gabbedey - Jeweller with no fingers,"A talented jeweller has found her own way to make miniature masterpieces worth thousands of pounds -- despite being born with no FINGERS. Annette Gabbedey, 48, spends months creating delicate rings and bracelets, glittering with precious diamonds and opals in her workshop. But the expert goldsmith does not have any special tools to help her work without digits - she simply adapts conventional crafting devices to create dazzling ornaments. Determined Annette - who insists she is not disabled - even says she could not imagine doing her job with fingers because they ""must get in the way"".",2014-01-26T11:52:37-05:00,152400273,237,76310726,130,112095,1994,https://i.vimeocdn.com/video/451204735_780x439.webp

1566,85852923,Kangaroos can't jump backwards,"Taking not too serious leaps while tip toeing on the edge about everything and nothing without a point and purpose. I mean it would be nice if we really could grow forever, but what if infinite growth on a finite planet is a fairy tale? Maybe it's hard to see if you already grow at such an exhilarating speed. Nonsense facts mixed with history and a political opinion form an abstract narrative on three independent but interwoven levels. Or simply: the most schizophrenic thing I could come up with.

1577,79484641,Mt.Wolf | Midnight Shallows,"Directors/Editors: in/out (Jean-Philippe Blunt & Thom Humphreys)
Director Of Photography: Rina Yang

Modernity and the birth of the photograph catalysed a revolution in our perception of time and motion. 

Inspired by the work of Etienne-Jules Marey, yet moving with the times into the digital era, we continue this dialogue between motion and capture.

By using the rigorous filmic process of 'step-and-repeat printing' as our foundation, we have digitally multiplied, delayed, freeze-framed and overlaid our shots. This layering up, in some cases, resulted in 50 video tracks. 

Compositing allowed for a more controlled and sculptural study of movement. Although a digital workflow the technique was incredibly tactile, much like the early days of celluloid. No images were computer-generated and certain sequences include up to 1,498 shots.

The multiplicity of the visuals generated by this chronophotographic approach evoked certain parallels with wider natural phenomena. The archive sections were a way of exploring these aesthetic semblances.

The story takes place in Lisbon at the time of the great maritime discoveries. Explorers, looking like pigs, arrive in the harbour after a long voyage across the oceans. Everywhere in the city small groups gather and congratulate each other. Couples meet again after a long separation and hug one another. They organize spontaneous round dances and celebrate their return. Meanwhile, a young pig has the strange feeling of being completely isolated from the others in his own native city...

1587,84128173,Wheel Of Life,"Paper is one of the most versatile and beautiful mediums available to makers, able to create and reproduce entire worlds at the cut of a blade. After years of experience perfecting this craft, The Makerie Studio teamed up with Director André Gidoin to magically bring one of these worlds to life, by creating and filming a hand made paper Zoetrope. 

A zoetrope is a device that produces the illusion of motion from a rapid succession of static pictures. Often referred to as the Wheel Of Life, we were inspired to tell the story of one zoetrope in particular, that one night came to life.

All filmed in camera, the horses on the carousel are spaced to spin in sync with the camera’s frame rate to create the illusion of motion. Each horse is carefully studied to follow the one before it, so that once at speed they appear to be galloping.

The zoetrope was filmed surrounded by a multitude of smaller carousels, all hand made for The Makerie Studio’s New York launch.

1592,83818210,The Art of Fighting // Short Documentary,"In 1999 Hussain Sadiqi fled the remote mountains of central Afghanistan as the Taliban stepped up their violent persecution of the Hazara people. This was to be the start of Hussain’s epic 20,000km journey to Australia. 10 years later, this self confessed ‘nomad’ is about to give up his new life in his new country to pursue a life long dream - a dream that was born over 20 years ago, when a young Hussain first saw a torn and battered picture of his life long hero, Bruce Lee.

1615,82095744,"Aidan Sheahan - ""Insight""","Vital Films presents ""INSIGHT"" with Aidan Sheahan. In association with Altitude Filmworks and Aspen/Snowmass. 
""Insight"" shows a unique look into skiing and the power forged within the athletes mind. As action sports athletes must push themselves physically, they also must equally push themselves mentally. 

“Action sports are a mental game. Every trick, variation and landing is generated in your mind as a vision or dream of what you want to do next.” 

""Insight"" was shot in Aspen/Snomwass terrain parks, using remote controlled drones and a Cineflex Camera. Vital Films is also proud to produce & edit all films using renewable solar energy.

Looking forward to advancing this premise into a game as far as my skills allow.  (that will be an even longer time coming :)  Enjoy!

1623,80837769,Peaks of Life | Tom Wheeler Documentary,"Peaks of Life is a short Documentary about UK rider and downhill racer Tom Wheeler. The documentary illustrates Tom's lengthy recovery and rehabilitation process after loosing the use of his right arm whilst racing in Rheola, Wales back in 2011. 

Despite paralysing his right arm, Tom's determination and dedication means he's able to do the things he loves most including riding his mountain bike again. A touching story that some may consider a tragedy at first, but with such a great out look of life Tom isn't letting his paralysed arm slow him down.

1634,80914114,Free People Presents The Cabin ft. Noot Seear,"Free People has launched a short film, titled 'The Cabin', as an accompaniment to our December catalog. As the film opens, videographer Jacques Naude unexpectedly discovers film from a weekend in his past. Memories flood back to the time when he and girlfriend, Noot Seear, were deciding the fate of their impassioned relationship. Facing life changes that threaten to split them apart, the couple decided to escape to where their love began: a rustic cabin in Maine. There, we watch as their romance unfolds. In simple moments together, surrounded by the peace of nature, the two are able to find a short refuge. Through affection, laughter, and adventure, one can see that their love is real. Will what they've realized hold them together, or will it encourage them to set each other free? As the weekend comes to an end, we discover what the next step is for Jacques and Noot.

1638,80476161,Typhoon Haiyan,"Natural disasters are grizzly things. There's no two ways about it. With little warning they appear, and when they leave they almost always take lives with them. There's no one to blame, and often times there's little that can be done in terms of preparation. After typhoon Haiyan destroyed the Philippines I was asked to document the aftermath. Naturally, I intended to capture a story of destruction. What I found however, was a story of resilience.

I hope this story encourages you to be thankful for what you have. Not just that you have a good job or a  nice car, but simply thankful that you're alive and have people around you to share your life with.

The Sydney-based typographer and creative, lends her dramatic stylised script to the already impactful black and white creative for Kirin Cider that sets the brand apart from anything else on the market. The majority of 3m x 4.5m signs were painted in Gemma’s studio, but on November 18, Gemma painted the signage for the Surry Hills location in situ, on the corner of Crown and Foveaux Street.

1658,79695097,IDIOTS,"It’s not a secret we love robots here at BLR, so we wanted them to be the heroes in our latest promo clip. Luxury cars with powerful engines to drive through roads under severe speed restrictions, cable TV that allows us to pay to watch all kind of sports, all from our comfortable sofa, and of course, hyper expensive cell phones that do almost everything but making a decent phone call.

Yes, our happiness is based on things we don’t need and governed by entities we don’t control, so what? Sit down and turn on the tv!

The robots were taken from real Japanese robot model kits, and they now hold a privileged position in our freak museum. The bad guy spits real smoke out of its mouth! The environment is made of cardboard houses that were integrated with the help of camera tweaks. It all serves to the purpose of creating a dumb homogeneous atmosphere in which we’re defined by what we’ve got, that is, the same lame things.

Don’t take the message too seriously. This is a promo video we’ve done to laugh at ourselves. We all have an i-diot inside, and it’s so fun!

In the future, a team of astronauts are sent on a ten year journey to a distant planet to find new life. On their way, they encounter a large, abandoned spaceship that is drifting in the orbit of a mysterious planet. They board the ship with anticipation of the great discoveries to uncover inside. However, they do not know what terrible secret this spacecraft keeps -- a nightmarish threat which is far bigger and scarier than anything they could have imagined.

Всем привет. Хочу представить свой короткометражный фильм Azarkant. Azarkant был сделан на чистом энтузиазме, в свободное время на домашнем компьютере. Я давно мечтал поработать над чем-то в своём любимом жанре космической фантастики, но ничего такого у нас не снимают, и потому я решил делать своими силами. В видеоролике вы можете найти отсылки ко многим голливудским фильмам которыми я вдохновлялся и засмотрел до дыр. Azarkant сделан скорее не как короткометражка, а как небольшой фрагмент большой истории.

Огромный космический корабль, затерянный на краю вселенной. Внутри которого всё мертво и кануло в забвение. Люди давно погибли и никто уже не расскажет что здесь произошло. Только старый робот, пилот которого тоже давно мёртв, продолжает одиноко патрулировать бесконечные коридоры и выполнять последнюю команду своего пилота. Но однажды, двери старого космического коробля снова открываются... 

Спасибо всем кто помогал: Арсений Сычев, Артём Новиков, Евгений Кревный, Василий Викторов, Валерий Кряжев - без них эта работа не была бы закончена.

Надеюсь вам понравится. Смотрите в HD.
Приятного просмотра!

1668,78254514,John Lewis 'The Bear & The Hare' - The Making Of,"Making of film directed by Jake & Josh
www.jakeandjosh.co.uk

The Bear & the Hare is the first John Lewis campaign to embrace the emotive power of animation, a filmic technique so evocative of Christmasses gone by.

Elliot and Yves took the two most traditional and time-honoured animation processes – stop-motion and traditional hand-drawn 2D animation – and combined them to create something innovative and unique. Their aim was to do almost everything in camera, using real lighting, lens and film craft to build a world where the audience can see and feel the painstaking work behind it. The 2D animation’s physical interaction with the set and the human imperfections inherent in the process create a hand-crafted piece full of heart and integrity.

The animation process involved constant shifts between 2D and 3D worlds. In order to achieve this complicated combination the whole film was first created in Blinkink Studios as a 3D previsualisation animatic with all the sets and characters built to scale. This allowed everything to be developed and planned alongside the modelmakers and animators, thus integrating the different disciplines and processes before the set was built or the characters were printed.

Aaron Blaise (Brother Bear, The Lion King, Mulan) and his team of veteran Disney animators at Premise Entertainment in Orlando, Florida, designed and animated the characters. The 2D-animation frames were printed onto mounted paper and cut with a laser. Each frame (nearly 4,000 in total) was then individually hand-labelled before going on set. Feature-film stop-frame animators then spent 6 weeks bringing the world to life.

The set was built by our production designer John Lee (Aliens, Fantastic Mr Fox, Frankenweenie) and his team at Shepperton Studios before being transported to Clapham Road Studios ready for the stop-motion shoot.

Post-production was done in-house in Blinkink’s animation studio, and the final grade was completed at MPC.

1673,78921928,Holi Shit,"Holi Shit takes a team of freerunners, geared up with a bunch of “toys” which were as great to play with as they are to watch in slow motion and follows their adventures through the abandoned suburbs of Berlin. 

During their three days journey, the freerunners and camera crew got lost more than once on the endless highways outside of Berlin Brandenburg. We also realized that the most interesting abandoned places are not only well concealed, but are well guarded by security and police. Ignoring those signs of warning the next days were packed with thrilling moments of spectacular runs and tricks but also, getting chased by ghost hunters at midnight, and getting arrested by the police while shooting a drone shot with smoke grenades on top of the tallest building in the area. Obviously not a good idea! 

Every big city has one thing in common. After a while it is quite hard to get out of a place filled with so much energy. Chasing those abandoned buildings and feeling the calmness of a place once filled with so much life was truly inspirational.

ADVECTION _ Robert Seidel
2-Channel Video Projection on a Water Fountain 
Dimension Fountain 10 x 7 m / Background 35 x 50 m

Commissioned by
4th Lichtsicht Biennale _ Bad Rothenfelde / Germany _ http://www.lichtsicht-biennale.de
27th September 2013 – 5th January 2014

Artist Statement
The work advection consists of several visual études projected on the continuously changing volume of a water fountain. Interconnected with both the circadian rhythm of their natural surroundings as well as the meteorological nuances of seasonal change from autumn to winter – the fixed études alter their density, texture and luminescence over the exhibition time. 

This highly organic pictorial frame spawns a contemporary form of moving abstract paintings or associative drawings. The volumetric fountain, the pond reflections and iridescent flares shape a plasmatic spatial system, which is extended by a secondary video projection. This additional layer illuminates the surrounding area, integrating vegetation and the passing visitors into an abstracted mirage-stage. 

Here, twining lines change their density within the evolving volume as fragile light patterns float in the bank of fog. The skeletal music composition is augmented by the sound of rippling water and the rushing fountain. Ultimately flickering projection segments and the emerging natural airstreams break the fluctuating formations, making every loop a unique permutation.

Two computers playing rock-paper-scissors. Each has its own random algorithm running, choosing one of the three possible items. Connected by an ethernet cable, each computer plays its hand — the winning pc gets a point.

German Description:

Stein schlägt Schere, Schere schlägt Papier, Papier schlägt Stein.

In der Installation SchereSteinPapier treten zwei Computer im bekannten Spielsystem gegeneinander an. Per Zufallsgenerator wählt jeder Computer synchron ein Symbol aus — Der Gewinner bekommt einen Punkt.  Im Gegensatz zur menschlichen Variante fehlt hier jedoch die pseudo-taktische Möglichkeit den Gegner zu lesen. Die Algorithmen die zur Entscheidung führen verfahren vor jedem Spiel nach dem selben Zufallsgenerator. Lerneffekt oder Taktieren sind ausgeschlossen. Und dennoch verleitet die Installation den Rezipienten dazu Partei zu ergreifen. Im klassischen Wettstreit der Spielfiguren Schwarz gegen Weiß wählt man instinktiv eine Farbe, setzt auf den Favorit oder wettet auf den Ausgang der Partie. Die Computer werden zu Avataren die sich verselbstständigt im virtuellen Ring bekämpfen.",2013-10-27T20:51:00-04:00,103971412,77,78716671,176,467871,9369,https://i.vimeocdn.com/video/454477273_780x439.webp

1689,77372063,SHHH- A Film by Freddy Chávez Olmos and Shervin Shoghian,"11 min I Fantasy/Horror I México/Canada

“Shhh” is a dark fairytale about a young boy, Guillermo, who uses his imagination to overcome his monstrous bully at night. Tired of being scared, Guillermo eventually takes matters into his own hands. Inspired by the lucid dreams of director Guillermo del Toro during childhood.

At the very beginning of the interview below, Guillermo del Toro discusses these childhood experiences with monster nightmares and lucid dreaming, which inspired this film:

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VD4kspP5hRs#t=22

This is an anti-bullying project created in our spare time with a low budget. A tribute to one the filmmakers we look up to since we were kids, Guillermo del Toro. It couldn't have been completed without many sleepless nights and a lot of help & support from our talented cast, crew, family and colleagues. The film had a great response in the festival circuit and we're very happy to finally share it with all of you here.
Please share/like/comment this film if you enjoyed it. We hope to bring more fun stuff to you. Gracias!

Happy Halloween!!! :)

Shot 35mm anamorphic in 1999, Highpoint Pool was eventually completed in 2013 after being on hold for over a decade. After sitting in film storage for 13 years, the negative was pulled, scanned, edited and completed with generous help from friends, some additional ADR from our own kids (now the same age of the kids acting in the film) and a couple small personal loans.

Chocolate bacon is a portrait of a young woman’s experiences in the first year of grad school, presented through a series of conversations re-contextualized by abstracted characters. The film is divided into 6 episodes showing slices of life from a 7 month time period and the voices are from real audio recordings. The vignettes are interspersed with pieces where the main character talks more specifically about her trials and tribulations in making the film.

""By a village situated in the mountains of Addis Ababa, I  saw kids sliding down the asphalt with plastic fixed to the underside of their shoes.

As a passionate skater, this inspired me to bring skating to this particularly tough neighbourhood as a way of empowering kids. 

As a result “Love in Action” Megabiskate project was born in my heart.

The community includes boys and girls between the ages of 6 and 19 in the Intoto area of Addis Ababa. Many of the kids are hawking in the city day by day and are slipping through the cracks in the system.

Megabiskate uses skateboarding as a tool for empowering youth, to create new opportunities and to be the potential for change.

We hope to grow a sustainable organization that is recognized locally and globally for changing the lives of youth through skateboarding. ""

1724,76357912,Young Galaxy - Sleepwalk With Me,"This animated music video is inspired by a heartfelt story of a relationship between two soldiers during the Second World War, called ""Letter to a G.I."", first published in 1953 and republished in September 1961 by ""ONE Magazine"" in the USA.

In the letter, one of the soldiers - Brian Keith - describes warmly the best moments that him and Dave (his partner) shared during the North African Campaign of 1943, when they first met. Unfortunately the story ends with a sad farewell to Dave, as he did not make it back home.

Thanks you Young Galaxy for the awesome music!

1730,75781782,Keloid,"In a not too distant future, societies of all countries come to rely on an intricate network of artificial intelligence devices designed to bring efficacy to man's life. Yet, man continues to devour himself in useless wars. A strong political hierarchy now divides all powers into three factions, and A. I. devices rapidly gain ground as efficiency becomes a priority. 
As social revolts grow worse everyday, authorities seek ways to control their citizens. They decide to carry out a series of tests that will determine not only whether some crucial powers can be transferred to non human entities, but also whether man is ready to yield those powers.
The world has become a cell for all man and women, who withstand and endure their lives, rather than living them. Machines might have found a solution.
From now on, you are set free. ..

-----------------------------------------------------------

Keloid is not about robots, it is about men. Big Lazy Robot created this spec film -- more than two years in the making -- with the purpose of giving free reign to the creative aspects of production that many times are so much missed during profit work. And yes, we enjoyed the ride!

1741,75177597,Silver Creek,"Silver Creek tells the tale of a young band of outsiders, isolated and teased in their community, who one day discover the magic of their own creativity and imagination. The kids find solace and support in their celebration, though the moment is short-lived, and others try to break them apart.

If viewers are moved by this short film’s message, they are encouraged to click the “TIP THIS VIDEO"" button right below this text. The funds raised from this are not only a “tip” - they are the necessary resources that make the work done by the beneficiary charities, the Trevor Project and Rainbow Resource Centre possible. Both organizations do exceptional work with LGBTQ youth in crisis and offer supportive services that make a vital difference in young people’s lives.

In 2012 Salazar set out across Canada driving over 2600 Kilometers from Vancouver, British Columbia to the village of Angusville, Manitoba to create Silver Creek. Over the course of 2 weeks the people of Angusville embraced our little band and our project, letting us shut down main street for days on end, invade their backyards, and throw confetti literally everywhere.

We cast local actors and kids from around the region and many residents came out to be background actors. Every night our crew and the community broke bread together in the town hall. It was a profoundly unique experience for all involved. For two weeks a band of 50 odd people came together as a family, we lived together, and got to play together at making a film. This tight knit togetherness fit with the spirit of what our film was trying to convey.

Curator and program director: Bianca Halaseh 

Budapest Art Factory (BAF) is pleased to present to you SYN-Phon; sound performance based on graphical notation by Candaş Şişman featuring Barabás Lőrinc & Ölveti Mátyás. Candaş Şişman resided at BAF for the month of June as part of its cross-cultural fertilization residency program. SYN-Phon will be exhibited to act, as a visual linguistic delivery through a cogitation segment followed by the sound performance on June 29th.

Coming about to understand the human nature of comprehending linguistics is that of a complex take –on. The constituent elements of language, in general content, bring forward the theory of other minds sharing, with intentioned communication. 

Thought varies with the use and absence of language that comes to be found in line with the development of thinking and impulses from our daily surrounding. Eventually language creates our point of view just as much as our ideas and perception of matters, individualistically. 

Art plays a crucial role in demolishing the boarders of our comprehension our mindset is framed into by literate language. Human language serves as a rather conservative form of communication when comparison to musical language; where the freedom of space employs as a resort for that broad horizon of that, that in search of cutting-edge form of broadcast. 

Candas’s trials of combing various forms don’t necessarily imply the mere creation of a pioneering flash but rather the use of the endless possibilities in associating the known and unknown. Through the unknown, we come about with a new way of thinking that tries to substitute and make space for a new tool of self-expression. Conclusively the graphical notation gives liberate opportunity in creating one’s personal language that holds its basis on feeling the visual and sound in parallel. 

Phonation, in accordance to Candas is the presence of sound language in SYN- Phon where the structure is supported by the synthesis itself. Music in its myriad forms extends to exploiting a communicative human language, thereby making the conceptual idea much more of significant importance than the actual tool. For Candas the presence of music in positively charged negatives spaces is a key element for substitution of the unknown seeking to be expressed. By the happening of SYN-Phon the line of musician will be crossed into a rather freely inflicted composer. Lőrinc and Mátyás as the musical inputs , on trumpet and cello respectively, of the performance will attain free expression 
rightfully to the impulses in line of creating a new language.

SYN-Phon sound performance will demonstrate an articulation based on Candas’s intimate collective findings of Budapest during the month of June. Buda and Pest in the separate geographical allocation hold different quintessence natures, in addition to the anecdote of recent flooding events of Duna the performance is meant to reach out to the audience as a sensual expressive language. The sound performance will include sounds, constructed and picked up in Budapest recorded by Candas himself. 
The whole bulk graphical notation will be available in print form to be part of the introductory assimilation.",2013-09-12T22:40:10-04:00,1018837170,656,75177597,58,156582,1745,https://i.vimeocdn.com/video/449774671_780x439.webp

1751,74599830,Lost & Found,"In a remote corner of New Zealand’s South Island, tucked away among the last remaining tracts of native forest, lies a little-known place of wonder. It is the life’s work and extraordinary creation of inventor, artist and self-confessed tinkerer, Blair Somerville.

For over ten years Blair has single-handedly owned, operated and ceaselessly expanded the Lost Gypsy Gallery, his wonderland of homegrown wizardry and a playground for kids and adults alike. Using only recycled materials, Blair takes DIY to artistic extremes. His creations are ingenious, interactive, and often hilariously impractical. They take many shapes and forms and share an uncanny ability to amaze, entertain and inspire.

‘Lost & Found’ invites you to take a peek into Blair's bizarre and beautiful world.

1757,63059519,"American Value: Herb Dishman: China, TX","""American Value: Herb Dishman, China, TX"" is the first episode of a short documentary series that investigates  our cultural fascination with vanishing traditions. This episode tells the story of a Texas Rice farmer and his decision to carry on his family's tradition of fatherhood and working the land. Herb's story complicates the cultural stereotype of the American farmer through highlighting a journey that took him away from home and around the world, ultimately leading him to realize that his true calling is being back where his journey began.

Between others...

This is a short we did just for fun between projects. We started designing the city, 7 months ago, and when it was done, we thought it would be nice if a monster tried to destroy it, failing in the process. ""Let’s add a goofy robot!"" we said. The idea was to have a simple 10-second piece with the robot failing. Just for the kicks. The funny thing was that when we included the Mon-star there, it wasn’t enough. So, between projects of course, we wrote a story and added more and more scenes... Then, when we were right in the middle of the project, the movie Pacific Rim came out; a terrible coincidence. Such bad luck! (The movie is really awesome). Anyways, we ended up with this 2-minute short. We never intended it to became a short in the first place, but it did. Please, enjoy!

I was lucky enough to be sent to Rio on assignment to shoot some Ultra HD 4K and 8K timelapse footage for a major electronics manufacturer. This video is a compilation of some of the footage I shot there. Most of the locations are within the city of Rio De Janeiro, but I also traveled to the famous Iguazú Falls on the border of the Brazilian state of Paraná and the Argentinian province of Misiones. In 2011 Iguazú Falls was announced as one of the seven winners of the New Seven Wonders of Nature by the New Seven Wonders of the World Foundation.

RIO DE JANEIRO
No wonder the beautiful city of Rio De Janeiro was chosen to host the 2014 FIFA World Cup and the 2016 Summer Olympics. Rio de Janeiro, or simply Rio, is the capital city of the State of Rio de Janeiro, the second largest city of Brazil, and the third largest metropolitan area and agglomeration in South America, boasting approximately 6.3 million people within the city proper. Part of the city has been designated as a World Heritage Site, named ""Rio de Janeiro: Carioca Landscapes between the Mountain and the Sea"", identified by UNESCO in the category Cultural Landscape.

Rio de Janeiro is one of the most visited cities in the southern hemisphere and is known for its natural settings, carnival celebrations, samba, Bossa Nova, balneario beaches such as Barra da Tijuca, Copacabana, Ipanema, and Leblon. Some of the most famous landmarks in addition to the beaches include the giant statue of Christ the Redeemer (""Cristo Redentor"") atop Corcovado mountain, named one of the New Seven Wonders of the World; Sugarloaf mountain (Pão de Açúcar) with its cable car; the Sambódromo, a permanent grandstand-lined parade avenue which is used during Carnival; and Maracanã Stadium, one of the world's largest football stadiums.

I hope you enjoy the video!

Lisa is an awesome, classy lady, but she values her privacy and preferred to be filmed in silhouette. We had a lot more interesting footage that couldn't make it into the final cut. The guy dancing in the bear costume is Scott, the guy in the leopard costume is Lisa Frank's young son.

1774,37156264,*The Less We Exist,"What do relationships mean in the era of the born-digital? This short film explores the topic of friendships online from one young woman's perspective, the elation and alienation of online interactions, and questions the meaning of what it is ""to know"" and ""to be friends"" with people in this day and age of digital intimacy, as well as what internet personae are and how they differ from our physical personalities. Who is online? Who is stalking us? This film forces the viewer to question their assumptions about who is a creep, and what message they are sending out with their carefully curated online images to whomever may stumble upon them.  
The original score provides a fitting backdrop to this visually and intellectually stimulating short, provoking questions for all of us about the meaning of leading our social lives online.
The film's medium is fitting, as the viewer watches the online interaction in seemingly real time as if they themselves were participating.

Field Mountains is a Madison, WI based band who graciously gave permission for this song to be used in this film.

More Info:
For those interested, I shot this with a Canon c100. Lenses used were the Canon 24mm IS prime, the Canon 50mm 1.4, the 100mm Macro IS 2.8 and the Tokina 11-16mm.  By far, most of it was shot on the 24 and the 100.  The final shot was done with my trusty 5DII as it was a pickup. There was no crew on this shoot. Just myself and Bianca.  The shoot took 3 days and post production took significantly longer. All the visuals were done in after effects.  I used Element3D a good amount.  Thank you to everyone who helped me out during all the time spent editing. You know who you are.

In a lifeless urban landscape where time itself has stopped its crawl, a mad ballet is commencing and a newly hatched butterfly is about to die.

1792,69161321,Skateboarder Magazine - Gurus in the Ganges (Full Length),"Is there a more ideal locale for skateboarding than to the teeming Kumbh Mela festival in North India which hosts what was estimated to be the world's largest religious gathering ever recorded?

The answer is yes, probably any back alley or random village street would be more productive and doable than at this joyous, ancient gathering. At the Kumbh Mela, Gurus and millions of other assorted Hindu devotees make their sanctified bathing pilgrimage to wash away their accrued sins at the confluence of the Ganges, and Yamuna Rivers, that takes place every dozen years in the city of Allahabad.

In early February 2013, Sean Malto, Sebo Walker, Mark Suicu and Nestor Judkins traveled to legendary India. Their plan was to traverse the breadth of the Subcontinent's core with their ultimate goal to reach the Kumbh Mela gathering. The four sought to try and demonstrate that even in the most densely populated, chaotic places in the developing world, one can indeed push forward and manage to skateboard despite the visceral challenges such conditions present.

1794,72104173,PRETTY LIGHTS around the block (directors cut),"I would like to dedicate this video to Cory Berg. He was the man who made it all happen. Sadly, he passed away in early 2015. He truly was a wonderful human being and i wish i had got the chance to hang out with him more.. RIP x 

I was brought on board by Strawberry Frog, a creative agency based in NY, and LG to make a music video for Pretty Lights. I worked closely with Derek (Pretty Lights) on the idea and aesthetic. We both wanted to revisit some of my well versed camera techniques as well as try out some new ones. It was a real pleasure spending time with him, cruising around Brooklyn, shooting elements and meeting people involved in the making of the record. We both liked the fact that our creative processes had certain analogue parallels and i feel like this video shows the success of that shared outlook. I hope you enjoy!",2013-08-10T13:19:03-04:00,159949788,242,61361236,53,42418,646,https://i.vimeocdn.com/video/494321439_780x439.webp

1796,72093321,"The Art of Krump ""journey to heaven"" feat. TightEyez & E.R.","by KAIZENPICTURES (www.kaizenpictures.com) - films with soul

/ KRUMP – Kingdom Radically Uplifted Mighty Praise /

Krump is a freestyle dance form popularized 2001 in the streets of South Central, Los Angeles (USA), that is characterized by free, expressive, exaggerated, and highly energetic movement.

The youths who originated krumping, 'Tight Eyez' and 'Big Mijo', saw the dance as a way for them to escape gang life and to release anger, aggression and frustration in a positive, non-violent way. This was an opposition to street violence, which was prevalent due to violent gangster activities.

With the cinema documentary 'RIZE' (2006) by the Hollywood Director ""David LaChapelle,"" Krump has spread all around the world.

Today, Krumping has world wide influence in the dance culture, but Krumping still has difficulty gaining acceptance by our society as an art form. Primarily, because people do not understand this dance form and its spirit.



/ EBS – European Buck Session /

EBS is the biggest Krump event in the world located in Germany. Dancers from all continents, nationalities, and economic environments come together to compete in battles and to find out one thing:

Who are the best in expressing themselves trough Krump?

1807,71546824,Free People Roshambo: Paper-Scissors ft. Christopher Abbott,"Free People has launched the final film, titled ‘Roshambo: Paper-Scissors,’ in the ‘Roshambo’ series to conclude the compelling story of two lovers, played by Christopher Abbott and Sheila Marquez. In the previous chapters of the series, we watched as Chris and Sheila, rekindled their romance, and witnessed Sheila’s heartbreak after parting ways with Chris. In ‘Roshambo: Paper-Scissors,’ we saw a parallel night to Sheila’s getaway in Rio from the previous film. Chris is staying in Paris, distracting himself with an alluring French woman played by actress, Ana Girardot. Although beautiful and charming, he cannot stop experiencing flashbacks to the true love that he has lost. Sheila’s image appears every which way, and his date quickly takes notice. We end where the first film left off and find out what path the lovers take; will they stay together, or will they part ways forever?

1828,70642037,Wonderland | A Short Form Doc on Creative Commerce,"In the spring of 2013 Hunter Hampton and Eskimo partnered to go on a filmmaking journey around the US to meet with various creative professionals in hopes of capturing a glimpse of what it is like to work in the creative industry. The idea was born out of our own questions and struggles on how to deal with things that may seem out of your control. 

The themes we decided to focus on were those of creativity, relationships, the pursuit of financial profit, and the many directions you can intentionally or unintentionally find yourself taking. We hope the short provides direction in helping others pursue their own creative and personal goals by hearing first hand experiences. Thank you to everyone involved for your transparency and willingness to be involved.

1834,6857186,End Scene,"This video was made by Steffen Bygebjerg in 2009 for the song ""End Scene"". The track is taken from Troels Abrahamsen's album WHT also from 2009. 

The animation work was made in Adobe After Effects. Each frame was then printed and the print was subsequently scanned back into the computer. The scanned frames were then assembled back into the original animation, now with a new rugged look, created by the visit in the physical analogue world. No effects added after scanning.

1846,68859229,e-David Robot Painting,"e-David, our painting machine, uses visual feedback to create different kinds of paintings. We equipped a standard robot with all necessary means for painting. Five different brushes can be used, color can be selected from a repository with 24 colors, brushes can be cleaned and colors can be distributed precisely on the canvas.

The machine watches itself while painting and decides indepentently where to add new strokes. This way paintings are created that are not completely defined by the programmer but are the result of a visual optimization process. (http://www.informatik.uni-konstanz.de/en/edavid/news/)

1856,68146128,"""Six Photographs"": René Burri","Iconic Swiss photographer takes us on a journey through six images from his archive, photographing figures like  Che Guevara chain-smoking in his office in 1963, Pablo Picasso in Cannes in 1957 and American G.I.s being entertained in a brothel in Seoul in 1961. 

Burri also recalls his iconic 1960 São Paulo photograph 'Men on a Rooftop, 1960', shooting the San Cristobal Stables in Mexico city in 1976 and the reopening of the Suez Canal in 1974, explaining why modern techniques like photoshopping are getting in the way of our pursuit for the truth....

“Uncle Luke is an incredibly original film, both in terms of its tone and the technique of its storytelling… Uncle Luke really taps into the popular culture of a specific generation, and it has a very healthy disrespect for convention and authority.” - Sundance Programmer

“Life and Freaky Times of Uncle Luke is undeniably entertaining, whether you get the cultural references or not. It is a smart and intricately self-reflexive example of what cultural theorist Jim Collins has called ‘the perpetual circulation and recirculation of signs that form the fabric of postmodern cultural life.’ Mayer and her collaborator are quintessential bricoleurs. In Uncle Luke, street-credible slang and classic booty beats reconstruct a landmark of film history. High and low, art and entertainment, fiction and reality become multiple facets of an intellectually-integrated work that specifically depends on cultural quotation. The parallels are both narrative and structural. Whereas La Jetee is constructed from stills, referencing the psychological relationship between photography and memory, Uncle Luke draws from the nostalgia power of Mayer’s two dimensional boards.” - Art Papers review

JONAH

Mbwana and his best friend Juma are two young men with big dreams. These dreams become reality when they photograph a gigantic fish leaping out of the sea and their small town blossoms into a tourist hot-spot as a result. But for Mbwana, the reality isn't what he dreamed – and when he meets the fish again, both of them forgotten, ruined and old, he decides only one of them can survive. Jonah is a big fish story about the old and the new, and the links and the distances between them. A visual feast, shot though with humour and warmth, it tells an old story in a completely new way.

Jean-Philippe from Dent De Cuir:
""The idea behind the video was to look at how the next generation are interacting with the internet and are faced with an ever expanding range of content. We employed early 1990's advertising aesthetics so we could recreate the internet by using toys as the media. It was an exciting (and intense) experience that felt like being back in childhood for 2 months""

Frenchie, Brooklyn, NY

Frenchie has owned Frenchie's Gym, in the Williamsburg section of Brooklyn, for 36 years.  The neighborhood keeps changing, but Frenchie's not going anywhere.

THIS MUST BE THE PLACE

There's no place like home. It's where we live, work and dream. It's our sanctuary and our refuge. We can love them or hate them. It can be just for the night or for the rest of our lives. But whoever we may be, we all have a place we call home.

THIS MUST BE THE PLACE is a series of short films that explore the idea of home; what makes them, how they represent us, why we need them.

We're always on the lookout for dwellings of all sorts. If you've come across any curious or eccentric homes, feel free to send them along.

We finally finished our latest music video for the Brooklyn based band Team Spirit.
Being only two people working on it, it took us little more than a month to complete but it sure was an inspiring and fun process.
Everything in the video is hand drawn from scratch on paper using fineliners. We then scanned all the artwork, colored it in photoshop and cut it out piece by piece to be able to animate it and put it together in After Effects.

1913,65536778,AEON - TEDxSydney Film,"AEON is an animated short film created to be a part of the 2013 TEDxSydney conference. It's purpose is to act as a 'palette cleanser' between talks. 

AEON explores the concepts of growth, loosely reflected as a cyclical journey across the natural seasons over the course of many years. We draw loose parallels between these natural seasons and the seasons within an individuals life. 

We purposely left the piece open to interpretation, but we would note that in developing AEON, we did explore the deeper concepts of life, existence and the identity of the individual within the broader cosmos. Where do we fit in when there is so much that is greater than the individual.

Our subjects are drawn from nature with moments particularly relevant to the Australian landscape from which many Australians forge their identity. We wanted the piece to be emotive and textured, opting for a stylised, low poly treatment complex in execution but nicely simplistic in its actual aesthetic. We wanted to explore geometry and the reduction of things to these core elements. The design and treatment a reflection of what is core to our existence.

Do but themselves confound;

He’ll with a giant fight,
He will have a right
To be a pilgrim.

Shall life inherit.

____________________


Far and away in the chilling northern reaches of Michigan farm country lived 16-year-old Andy Phelps: an anomalous prodigy with a colorful resume. Andy juggled knives and fire for mass audiences, hand-made wood furnishings, thundered his motorcycle through the Midwest, captained his hockey team to a State Championship, and taught himself to unicycle and fire-breathe...all before turning seventeen. But late one autumn morning in 1998, Andy broke his neck and consequently lost the use of his hands and legs. Over a decade later, what should have been the last chapter in the life of a fabled prodigy became the first page of a new story, where against all odds he became the only known quadriplegic in an unexpected profession.

1950,62571137,Beauty Pockets,"'Beauty Pockets' is the first surf short from Epokhe. 
The Pacific HWY played host. Strange things happen on the road, strange but beautiful. The view from a car window is hypnotic. A quick bolt from the Epokhe HQ in Byron Bay and the team found waves in the South Coast of Australia. The Signing just months prior of Epokhe ambassador Creed McTaggart saw the team in need of some bonding. The Highway, a place where conversation is required. 7 days on the road, a small south swell, Big cities, bars, landscapes, isolation, lunatics and talents…anything that makes you stop and pull the camera out.

1959,62773137,23 Degrees 5 Minutes - animated short film,"An old explorer close to freezing in the Arctic re-lives the events that have brought him there. He recalls his student days at Trinity College in Dublin when he studied under the enigmatic Professor Orit, the professor who was driven to madness by his obsessive pursuit of the unified theory. Convinced that the answer somehow lay in the relationship between the numbers two, three and five, Professor Orit's obsession started the journey which has led his former student to the top of the world. 

Directed by Darragh O'Connell, featuring the voice talents of John Hurt and Stuart Townsend and produced by Colm Tyrrell, the film was scripted by Darragh O'Connell based on a short story by Austin Kenny. Nominated for an IFTA in 2012, '23 Degrees 5 Minutes' was funded under the Frameworks scheme from the Irish Film Board, RTE and the Arts Council of Ireland.

Alchemy is a short film about transformation. In nature, everything is constantly changing: the earth, the sky, the stars, and all living things. Spring is followed by summer, fall and winter. Water turns into clouds, rain and ice. Over time, rivers are created, canyons carved, and mountains formed. All of these elements, mixed together, create the magic of nature's alchemy.

Nine days of exploring later, and the band had collected over 1,000 sound recordings and inspiration for the album they would subsequently write and record in Berlin.",2013-04-02T09:11:26-04:00,276703405,297,63649144,26,58638,1737,https://i.vimeocdn.com/video/433997390_780x439.webp

1967,54680077,MOTHERLAND | Mutterland,"In a totalitarian propaganda world ruled from above, a girl can be all it takes to spark off a revolution and challenge the MOTHERLAND.

The narrative and imagery of MOTHERLAND is based on stereotypic characters and motives that are abundant in propaganda art of the 1920s & 1930s: The innocent child in need of protection by the heroic soldier, the benevolent ruler and the patriotic worker. They all live and serve for the nuturing mother state. In MOTHERLAND this original meaning has been turned on its head to reveal an underlying, terrifying truth behind the propaganda.

Whilst the world depicted gives the audience a look into a stylized past, it was built and realized using cutting edge 3d real-time technology. Crytek's CryENGINE was used for previs and to render out set extensions & background vistas to be used in compositing. Approximately 66% of all shots feature real-time rendered background elements.

MOTHERLAND is a diploma project produced at The Institute of Animation
Filmakademie Baden-Württemberg

••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••

Originally written as a stageplay under the tutelage of theater, film, and TV legend Tom Skerritt, I adapted Free Pie for the screen and partnered with producers Gabe Berghuis, Aaron B. Smith and the Gorilla Film Community in Grand Rapids to shoot the film in two nights. With three dedicated actors and a small crew, the filming took place in a puzzling house designed by a cathedral architect shortly before his death (the present homeowner being incapable of residing at the home, due to a mysterious allergy). 

Because the 10-minute film takes place in real-time, the entire team was able to experience the actors performing the script from start to finish as though they were watching a play. Given the short shooting schedule to execute the ambitious deep-focus look (the film was shot exclusively on a 18mm and 25mm Master Primes), the live performance of the film proved to be an invaluable way of creating a unified vision for the cast and crew.

1971,62741577,BODY MEMORY,"Stop-motion film by Ülo Pikkov.
Estonia / 9 min

What can an old apple tree tell us? What mysteries are hidden in his roots, gnarled over time? Does he remember the serpent and the lost Paradise? Our body remembers more than we can expect and imagine. It remembers the sorrow and pain of our predecessors. It keeps alive the stories of our parents and grandparents as well as their ancestors. But how far back is it possible to go in your bodily memory?

The stop-motion animation BODY MEMORY takes as its central concept the idea that our body remembers, not only individual experiences, but also the sorrow and pain of our predecessors. A powerful visualization of subconscious processes and the hidden horror of deportation. Inspired by historical events: the Soviet deportations from Estonia in the 1940s.

This metaphorical surrealist tale is an allusion. Nightingales in December is a trip into the memories, and the fields of the current realities. What if the Nightingales were working, instead of singing and going south? Is the innocence the only savior of birds songs? There are no Nightingales in December... What is left, is only the history of our beginning, and our end.

1975,62330832,Electrosmog Montréal,"The radiofrequency spectrum is at the heart of telecommunications, used by police, emergency personnel and public transport services, as well as the armed forces. Every day, this spectrum ensures the proper functioning of mobile phones and wireless devices. Seen as an essential resource by some and as a health hazard by others, the electromagnetic fields generated by radiofrequency spectrum activity have multiplied exponentially since humans first learned to harness electricity. In his Electrosmog series, Jean-Pierre Aubé searches out ambient radio frequency activity in the urban landscape of Montréal, which for Aubé forms a singular territory, characterized by its density in the city and by the political and economic issues that accompany it.
Equipped with a radio, an antenna, and home-made software, the artist sweeps the titular spectrum of radio frequencies. Every tenth of a second, the device takes a snapshot of its readings – a measure of electromagnetic activity on a specific frequency. This information is then paired with images of Montréal, digitally altered by these same measurements, to create a “documentary in sound” of the city’s spaces.
Montréal, well-known to the artist after years of radiofrequency experiments here, is the eighth city in which Aubé has measured and visually presented this urban Electrosmog.

So I decided to list 30 things I knew about myself so far... I been staring at that list during the whole year and realizing that most of them wouldn't change with time...

I decided to create a GIF animation to each one of them.
And this was the result. If you know me, then you probably know these things already! :)

1977,57297653,quicksand,"An elderly gentleman attempts to retrieve forgotten memories.
—
A week prior to his passing, my grandfather shared with me his former aspirations of becoming a filmmaker. After numerous hardships, a narrow escape from the Nazis and an immigration to the US, the dream slowly, but surely, faded away. After his passing, I uncovered an archival trove of dust-covered 8mm film that had seemingly not been viewed by anyone for at least a generation. Mesmerized, what unfolded before me was something most people, myself included, have never witnessed before: the development and utter decline of the human body and mind. Motivated by my grandfather's unfulfilled dreams of filmmaking, I decided to piece together a film that he had already unwittingly made.

quicksand is not only a personal tribute to my grandfather or father, but to anyone that has ever experienced loss. Whether it be a loss of a loved one, or a loss of memories, quicksand embodies the enigma of life and death.

The idea for this one minute video comes from something my mom told me when I was a child, that I never forgot and which is still true today.

Following an interesting comment I received, I would like to say that to make this video, I followed the different people of my family and some friends as they were really using the water in their daily tasks. I did not ask them to re-do something, there was only one take. No water was wasted in the making of the video!

ABOUT THE SHORT FILM

This is my first animated short film based on the Batman character. It took me three years to complete it during my spare time after work, weekends and holidays with only the help of my friend Javier Esteban to get the lighting in some shots. I could say that it was one of the best experiences ever. I always have been a huge Batman fan and I could say that this is my personal tribute to him and his world. My main references and inspiration came from Bruce Timm's ""Batman The Animated Series"" to the very last Chris Nolan's version ""Batman Begins"" through the amazing Tim Burton's ""Batman"" and ""Batman Returns"".

Offf Festival has been a multicultural design conference event for years. From the beginning, I wanted to explore a different approach. Titles was executed with diverse ranges of techniques to underline sub-context, gathering different imagination, disciplines, mediums and artists. 

Used techniques vary from computer graphics to live action, macro photography to photocopy art. One single concept unifies the variation. It is the simplicity. In contrast with the strong imagery typography plays a subtle role, placed in the centre with only two weight variations of a geometric typeface.",2013-03-06T16:47:21-05:00,82080031,110,15023343,83,89739,2965,https://i.vimeocdn.com/video/143148646_780x439.webp

TRANSCRIPT
This royal court of kings, this blood-stained ground, 
This city cauldron, this throne of Mars,
This street sanctuary, and combat zone,
A fortress, inside a citadel, raised to stand,
Against adversaries, jesters, pretenders,
Against true players and those who merely come, to play. 
This fighting pack, this world all its own,
This game of hours, dark nights, threatening dawns, 
Which serves as refuge, home and shelter,
Or as a rampart defensive to the squall.
Against the tyranny of outcasts and outsiders -
This arena.
This battleground.
This square of dirt.
Give me my robe, put on my crown, 
I have eternal longings to be king.",2013-02-26T12:35:07-05:00,200142861,105,59106292,11,32813,591,https://i.vimeocdn.com/video/422931505_780x439.webp
2009,60763684,The Me Bird,"The short film ""The Me Bird"" is a free interpretation of the homonym poem by Pablo Neruda. The inspiration in the strata stencil technique helps conceptualize the repetition of layers as the past of our movements and actions. The frames depicted as jail and the past as a burden serve as the background for the story of a ballerina on a journey towards freedom. A diversified artistic experimentation recreates the tempest that connects bird and dancer.

I am the Pablo Bird,
bird of a single feather,
a flier in the clear shadow
and obscure clarity,
my wings are unseen,
my ears resound
when I walk among the trees
or beneath the tombstones
like an unlucky umbrella
or a naked sword,
stretched like a bow
or round like a grape,
I fly on and on not knowing,
wounded in the dark night,
who is waiting for me,
who does not want my song,
who desires my death,
who will not know I'm arriving
and will not come to subdue me,
to bleed me, to twist me,
or to kiss my clothes,
torn by the shrieking wind.
That's why I come and go,
fly and don't fly but sing:
I am the furious bird
of the calm storm.

2013,58224211,SYNESTHETIC LOCKED,"""Synesthesia is the involuntary and interconnected stimulation of the senses produced by a unexpected source. See sounds, feel colors, hear geometric figures, smell moments... But once you have experienced that kind of sense connections hardly you will be able to perceive something with no associations. You are synesthetic locked.""

One day, while learning 3d in a tutorial, I found an article that caught my attention, a new word to learn ""Synesthesia"". So I decide to put some sense to my tutorial tests. 

I realized that we are exposed from a early age to all kind of situations that bring sensations, those give us experiences, bad or good ones.  Colors, flavors, sounds… They all are stored in our memories. When we faced all kind of incentives we remember our experiences automatic and unconsciously, giving a bunch of qualifying adjectives to the things we perceived, The weird thing about this is that I'm not able to see colors with no feeling cold or heat,  I can't hear a sound with no imagining forms, smelling scents with no seeing fruits, flowers, food. All of this creates a barrier of predisposition. How does it feel not to mixing senses? How to see a a color and not feeling anything?

I decided to shape some of my own synesthetic experiences. There are phrases in the video that represent the mind's conscious side (voice off) and some the subconscious one (icons, graphics). 

The technique I used to realize this short is mainly a collage of 3d and real action video, these clips were taken from the vimeo's https://vimeo.com/groups/freehd Free HD Stock footage group. So I want to thank to Phil Fried, to share his useful material.

2022,58729480,pariah - signal loss (official music video),"This Video is the result of an open task Video Project at the Köln International School of Design, on which we worked from December 2012 to February 2013. We used the Microsoft XBOX360 Kinect and ReconstructMe to scan a human body to create the character. After rigging, we used MoCap-Data for the model animation. The seemingly simple yet vibrant low-poly environment was created to mirror the melancholic mood of Pariah's track. It took over a week to render the clip on a 8-machine renderfarm, we set up at the university. Please feel free to ask, if you have any further questions.

Thanks to everyone for the numerous reviews, reposts and all the postive feedback for our project!

2023,59956490,To This Day,"To This Day is a project based on a spoken word poem written by Shane Koyczan (http://www.shanekoyczan.com) called “To This Day”, to further explore the profound and lasting impact that bullying can have on an individual.

Schools and families are in desperate need of proper tools to confront this problem. We can give them a starting point... A message that will have a far reaching and long lasting effect in confronting bullying.

Animators and motion artists brought their unique styles to 20 second segments that will thread into one fluid voice.
This collaborative volunteer effort demonstrates what a community of caring individuals are capable of when they come together.

Poland is a country with a very brutal past, even so recent at just 70 years ago. The holocaust is something I have thought about often as a child, especially as a 3-year-old with a vivid imagination and my father sitting me in front of the television to watch Pink Floyd's 'The Wall' film. I have always wanted to visit the German Nazi concentration camps and let the seriousness and power of it envelop me, humble me, and change me. It was one of the most chilling moments of my life, also because of how peaceful and beautiful the camps were. Spring flowers blooming bright and birds playfully jumping over the brick rubble. The calm breeze definitely added to its eeriness.
Poland has this tension that is slowly healing itself as time goes by and newer generations emerge, but you cannot look in any direction without the constant reminder of the past whether it is the remnants of the ghetto wall, or the cautious faces of the elderly. This piece was supposed to be about Auschwitz, but in making the video the surprise was how vibrant, tough, and full of life the Polish people are. I was as emotionally impacted with these new wonderful friends and sensory overload of the gorgeous present-day country as I was with sympathy and sadness at the camps. Even though they are very tough souls, I started to admire them and their country.
I chose to not only observe present-day Auschwitz, but also present-day Poland, document both, and show them as I felt them...knowing the strength of these people who looked forward and fought tooth and nail so the new generations could live these beautiful lives today inspires me so much. This is my tribute to Poland, its people, and the ones who perished in World War II.

****The title 'Bipoland' is meant to describe the two feelings of the past and present while I was there. On one hand, there is a heaviness that still lingers from WWII, but on the other hand things are as bright and exciting as any other flourishing country.

GERDA WEISSMANN KLEIN SPEECH:
Kary, Sheila, Sandy, Michael, my beloved husband and my family. I have been in a place for six incredible years where winning meant a crust of bread and to live another day. Since the blessed day of my liberation I have asked the question, why am I here? I am no better. In my mind's eye I see those years and days and those who never lived to see the magic of a boring evening at home. On their behalf I wish to thank you for honoring their memory, and you cannot do it in any better way than when you return to your homes tonight to realize that each of you who know the joy of freedom.

WINSTON CHURCHILL SPEECH:
Poland has again been overrun by two of the great powers which held her in bondage for a 150 years, but were unable to quench the spirit of the Polish nation. The heroic defense of Warsaw shows that the soul of Poland is indestructible, and that she will rise again like a rock, which may for a spell be submerged by a tidal wave, but which remains a rock.",2013-02-19T11:03:46-05:00,464846284,322,59767453,74,131843,1402,https://i.vimeocdn.com/video/415600127_780x439.webp

2049,58449984,New York Biotopes,"My bachelor graduation project „New York Biotopes“ deals with abstract plants and creatures, which change their forms because of insufficient living space and adapt themselves to the surroundings of the metropolis New York City. A type of metamorphosis, where the newly developed vegetation assimilates elements of the city and makes them useful for their own purposes. These creatures and plants, partly mechanical, partly organically in appearance, spread more and more over the city and fill it up with life.

My idea was to create a film, that fills up the metropolis New York with vegetation, that adapts to the straightness of the technology and the given situation. This happens through the assimilation of structures and forms. These biotopes are shaped by the existing living environment, but in turn also shape the newly developed living environment by their presence. In other words, a symbiotically coexistence begins.

2070,57192213,Chennai to Pondicherry: A Motorcycle Tour of Southern India,"During a once in a lifetime trip to Southern India, we had the chance to capture some sights and sounds while we made our way from Chennai to Pondicherry on motorbikes.  The trip was overwhelming and a truly eye opening experience. We at VBF knew that it would be very difficult to re-create on film the actual experience of being in India on the streets with thousands of cars, tuk-tuk's, cows, goats, and dogs.  The visuals, sounds, and smells all created a sensory overload situation that can only be experienced by being there, but hopefully this film gives you a sense of what it was like to be immersed in the surroundings and experience the amazing places along the coast of Southern India.

Flowers Timelapse compilation (Amaryllis, Lilies, Easter cactus, Rose, Gladiolus, Tulip, Gardenia)

I took more than 7100 photos in more than 730 hours (using Canon 5D Mark II)

It is my first timelapse, hope you'll enjoy it :)
http://www.pruskova.com

The music is called Arrival of the Birds by The Cinematic Orchestra... amazing music, my favorite..

Adding more details according to questions I've been recieving: 

It was shot in a homemade ""studio"" that I made in a cabinet. I covered the back of the cabinet with black cloth, the flower was placed in the middle, and the whole cabinet was then covered with another cloth to insulate from the daylight (to keep the light constant, which is the most important). Two led lamps were used to illuminate the flowers. 
Some flowers bloomed in hours, some in few days.. therefore the interval between photos varies from few seconds to several minutes depending on the type of flower.. after several missed tries you'll learn ;) 

In order to keep ISO as low as possible (couldn't go lower than 640 because of low light), the shutter speed was usually 1/5 s at f16. 

All flowers are mine or from my mother's garden :)

Destructive fishing techniques are common practice amongst the coastal populations of the Coral Triangle. The favoured methods are homemade fertiliser bombs and potassium cyanide, which have not only decimated reefs in the largest and most diverse marine bio-region in the world but have destroyed countless human lives as well.

Of all these communities, the Bajau Laut have perhaps suffered the most. The Bajau Laut are some of the last true marine nomads. An ethnic group of Malay origin, they have for centuries lived out their lives almost entirely at sea, plying a tract of ocean between Malaysia, the Philippines and Indonesia. In the last few decades, many have been forced to settle permanently on land, but a dwindling number still call the ocean home, living on long boats known as lepa lepa. Traditionally, they fish with nets and lines and are expert free divers, going to improbable depths in search of pearls and sea cucumbers or to hunt with handmade spear guns.

But these traditional techniques have been largely replaced by cyanide and dynamite fishing, practices that are being driven predominantly by the live fish trade – an industry whose global worth is estimated at US $1 billion. The trade’s epicentre is Hong Kong, while Indonesia supplies most of the fish, accounting for nearly 50% of all imports. Target species are grouper and Napoleon wrasse, reef species that are a key to the preservation of coral ecosystems.

Traditional Bajau cosmology – a syncretism of animism and Islam – reveals a complex relationship with the ocean, which for them is a multifarious and living entity. There are spirits in currents and tides, in coral reefs and mangroves. My point of interest is the potential for dovetailing the Bajau’s uniquely intimate understanding of the ocean with wider marine conservation strategies in order to facilitate them in conserving rather than destroying their culture and the spectacular marine environments they have called home for centuries.",2010-12-02T17:39:22-05:00,1579504677,697,57192213,74,137864,2591,https://i.vimeocdn.com/video/396605398_780x439.webp

Title:	Re:Sound Bottle

Synopsis of work:
This is a music medium that can reproduce a recorded voice as music. It makes a database of sound sources that is managed and used as formal and automatic repetitions, and forms a music medium of the day. I felt something missing in the habitual use of music reproduction media, so I thought to create an interactive music medium that changes. By using everyday voices as sources of music, the sounds that are heard all the time every day carry infinite possibilities and help us reaffirm the enjoyment of music. I hope people can experience their own music.",2012-05-27T08:22:50-04:00,481903401,162,56075298,11,34528,562,https://i.vimeocdn.com/video/396610855_780x439.webp

Animated by Fraser Davidson (www.sweetcrude.tv).",2012-12-18T12:11:08-05:00,95448899,70,42921558,64,305353,3180,https://i.vimeocdn.com/video/448257073_780x439.webp
2095,55887965,Trip to Mexico,"License royalty free stock footage at www.motionplaces.com

I brought my new Blackmagic Cinema Camera with me on a recent trip with my wife to the Bahia de Banderas area of Mexico. We stayed in Mismaloya, about 20km south of Puerto Vallarta. If I had it my way, the camera would have been glued to my hands for the entire trip, but considering it's not water-proof, I had to leave it at the hotel quite a bit.

We did a day trip north of Puerto Vallarta and explored towns, beaches, and did a small jungle hike. In Valle De Banderas, they were celebrating their town's anniversary, or at least I think that's what a banner said. At any rate there were many people out celebrating.

I love shooting with the BMCC! Little issues aside, it is an amazing camera! I love how it makes me slow down while shooting. Considering I'm getting about 25 minutes of raw footage on each 240gb SSD, and the fact that you can't delete clips or format the drive from the camera, makes me feel as if I'm shooting film. On this trip I had no way of downloading footage or formatting the drives. It felt like having an old slr film camera with me and just a couple rolls of film.

I shot all raw and processed the images in Lightroom. I had thought to take Resolve for a spin, but my main workstation stopped working and Resolve won't run on my laptop. I used a calibrated HP monitor.

I experimented with different color grades and you will see different styles in this film. There's even a single random BW shot in there. Uncompressed raw and 13 stops of dynamic range is a powerful mix. Being able to process the raw images in a variety of programs is freeing, and re-processing old footage with new color correction tools is something I look forward to.

Download the original if you want to see the full quality. Not much else to say really. It's good this camera will be shipping in larger quantities soon. Sorry to use an already over used phrase, but this camera is a game changer and needs to be in more people's hands! I can't wait to see what people shoot with it, and what the other camera manufacturers come up with to compete.

P.S. The reality of owning a camera called the Blackmagic Cinema Camera is at times a bit awkward. I'm finding myself saying things like, ""No, I'll use the Black Magic."" which tends to make strangers in the vicinity raise an eyebrow. Oh well. It's a small price to pay.

2097,55791061,Stray short film,"An iAnimate.net internal student project, directed by fellow student Andrew Atteberry. 

About the project from the director: This is a collaborative short film project I initiated during my time at iAnimate, a series of online animation workshops created by Dreamworks animator Jason Ryan. I was very fortunate and lucky to have so many talented animators want to help me with this project that were also attending iAnimate at the time. In addition to the help I received from iAnimate, Magnetic Dreams Animation Studio helped me bring this film across the finish line by allowing me use of their render farm and a large portion of their staff. Magnetic Dreams went so far above and beyond the call of duty in helping me to get this project through all of the stages of production, I certainly could not have pulled this together without them. Solid Angle was a big part of the team as well, they graciously helped with render licenses for their proprietary render engine ""Arnold"" which really helped add a beautiful look to the final frames. Finally, music and sound design provided by wonderfully talented Cathleen Flynn and Tim Gilmer (respectively) They really stepped up when I needed something unique and fitting and gave this film its voice. I'm extremely proud of what this group of people, from all corners of the globe, accomplished together (especially considering the non-existent budget :) I hope that you enjoy STRAY as much as I enjoyed the experience of making it!

Pinokio is an exploration into the expressive and behavioural potentials of robotic computing. Customized computer code and electronic circuit design imbues Pinokio with the ability to be aware of its environment, especially people, and to expresses a dynamic range of behaviour. As it negotiates its world, we the human audience can see that Lamp shares many traits possessed by animals, generating a range of emotional sympathies. In the end we may ask: Is Pinokio only a lamp? – a useful machine? Perhaps we should put the book aside and meet a new friend.

The Leaf Woman and the Centaur is a stop-motion animated film that looks to reconcile a set of creation myths and re- establish the act of experiencing the story as their central component. In the same way Paradise Lost articulated the felix culpa (beneficial fall of man) within the Biblical beginnings, or Dante's Inferno explored our ethical and spiritual scaffolding, The Leaf Woman and the Centaur will use the same basic tropes present in every creation myth to emphasize the value of an ancient experience that died with the cold logic of words.

Want to see the TEASER TRAILER before this? https://vimeo.com/54362904

Director's note: We shot this piece in Sweden (Gävle, Strängnäs and Uppsala) on a ""shoestring budget"", using just one 5D-Mark II-camera (with Canon L-series lenses). Our very first mission was actually to help another company (Quixel) with some live-action shots/scenes to simply showcase their new texture-tool for 3d-models in games and movies, but instead we came up with this concept idea and created a full blown short film. Primarily, we wanted to do something visual and entertaining to simply present this concept and showcase Quixel's tools.
We did almost everything our self (with some 3d/texture/sfx help) and we used close friends/family members to be ""actors"", including myself playing the main character. So I guess that's why the acting isn't top notch and why we didn't use so much dialogue ;) BUT we also wanted to keep it very visual, we wanted to tell a story with pictures (and UI-text of course). That was a big challenge but I think we succeeded. In the end we're happy with the end result considering the conditions and people really seem to like it! That's awesome to see and very rewarding! / Jimmy & Eric""

There are quite a few people or organisations who we couldn't have made this film without. The Roundhouse for providing funding and assistance, Esme Solnick for letting us use her house and sharing her worldly wisdom, Guy Gotto for arriving on the day and being thrust into the DOP seat, Sami for finding most of the cast and busting a gut on the sound design and music, Mia for letting us use her house to spend countless hours in a dark room with tiny horses, and then Jony and the Levins for helping out in all kinds of ways. And then there's the rest of the cast and crew who all did a sterling job. So thanks a lot everyone.

2155,52703690,POP POP BANG,"A collaboration between creative director Anna Burns and the photographer Thomas Brown. Through the use of various mediums the pair have curated an exhibition that explores the masculine world of B-Movies and juxtaposed it with the traditional British landscape. Using the themes of said movies – girls, guns and explosives – and twisting it against a very British backdrop these two challenge not only the premise of each subject but also the use of their chosen medias. The duo created a wall of umbrellas displaying elements of the classic B-Movie and located them within three landscapes – one being the forest, then London’s docklands and finally the grounds of Suffolk Manor house.

Cinematographer: Thomas A.

WhoMadeWho and Good Boy! Creative finish off their acclaimed ""Pitfalls of modern man"" video trilogy with a darkly humorous tale about spoiled and greedy modern men who, in the words of Mr. Burns, would ""give it all for a little more"".

This two-part video - covering the singles ""Running Man"" and ""The Sun"" from this years ""Brighter"" album - takes place at a fictional media company ""Umlaut Creative"" run by WhoMadeWho's Tomas Barfod. 

The company's handsome, succesful employees are all smug and content in their cushy worlds of creative class self-righteousness and material prosperity. But when the company's HR guy makes them fill out a list entitled ""10 things to do before you turn 40"" their fragile bubbles burst, confidence turns to envy and envy erupts into violence...

The previous WhoMadeWho/Good Boy! Creative videos ""Keep Me In My Plane"" and ""Every Minute Alone"" have toured festivals all over the world and recieved widespread acclaim for their ambitious thematic depth, unusual for the music video medium. Both clips were nominated at the prestigious UK Music Video Awards. 

The dual ""Running Man/The Sun"" video is an attempt to push the boundaries of the medium even further, by telling a thoughtprovoking story of high complexity in an exiting and original form.",2012-06-02T14:12:34-04:00,661713217,660,52223526,77,75393,1285,https://i.vimeocdn.com/video/360272745_780x439.webp

Ruckazoid – Don’t Let Me Go (She ain’t mad at it) is an experimental, surreal journey into alternative graphical realities, planets and species. It depicts the need of lifeforms to make contact, but subliminally points out the fears of providing oneself as a target at the same time. We as humans search for other species in deep space, but what happens if we actually find them? 
“Two possibilities exist: either we are alone in the Universe or we are not. Both are equally terrifying.” ― Arthur C. Clarke

Some people with autism have difficulty processing intense, multiple sensory experiences at once.  This animation gives the viewer a glimpse into sensory overload, and how often our sensory experiences intertwine in everyday life.  

Created as part of Mark Jonathan Harris' and Marhsa Kinder's ""Interacting with Autism."" Coming in January 1st 2013, IWA is a three-year transmedia project  funded by the federal Agency for Health Research and Quality (AHRQ).  University Professor Marsha Kinder, the Executive Director of the Labyrinth Project at USC, and Mark Harris are heading a team of filmmakers and artists working to build an interactive, video intensive website that will focus on the best available treatments for autism.

What does need to be pointed out is that during the final day of post-production on the video the three musicians from 
PUSSY RIOT got sentenced to serve time in prison for raising questions. They did this in the only way they could... 
LOUD. OBNOXIOUS. TRUTHFUL. 
In the opening shot of the video a text on a building reads ""Free-of-charge riot for the pussycat"" in Cyrillic (Russian) text. This video is dedicated to people who take risks. 
What is the last time you took one?

2187,51114070,ANIMA,"This short film seemed to will itself into being - it started as a small project that was plagued at every turn by disaster - but, miraculously, it grew and morphed at each hurdle it faced and became more and more meaningful and personal as a result. It is, broadly speaking, a story of a man letting go and finding himself, much as this video found its own way almost despite our involvement.

This video is without dialogue and external action. It's also incredibly personal. It was very important and cathartic for us to make. But we made it earnestly, as a gift for whomever sees it. We hope it strikes a chord and continues to live without us.

I was the girl in the green evening gown and the shattered glass slippers. You kissed my hand. We were lovers once. We met in the park; on a pier; in the first-class cabin of the Titanic. We sank with the ship. I have written songs about all this and other things too. I hope you enjoy.

2191,51198548,The Origin of Creatures,"A futuristic vision of a world after a catastrophic disaster. In this dark parable mutated limbs are looking for cooperation, but due to miscommunication this mission is doomed to fail.

The storyline of The Origin of Creatures is based on one of the most well-known tales about collaboration, the Tower of Babel. This tale is transformed and twisted and is set in an imaginary future, after the world is hit by a catastrophe. Among the remains of a devastated city lives that what is left of humanity. Human bodies are divided into separated parts of the body and are fused to special beings. Together, these creatures form a colony, they can only survive when collaborating. In the rubble of destroyed buildings they are trying to build a nest as large and as high as possible, so that the colony’s queen gets enough sunlight to reproduce, but due to miscommunication this mission is doomed to fail.

Humans are part of the natural order. We're risen apes that acquired language and learned to use tools. Skyscrapers and spacecraft may seem unnatural, but they're just as much a part of the natural order as beaver dams and bird nests. Boring electrical lines hint at the energy solution of a mammalian species. Open your eyes to the world you've grown accustomed to, and rejoice in the fact that you participate in the human project. - @ReidGower - http://www.twitter.com/reidgower

2196,51333291,ORDOS,"Built for 1 million people and currently inhabited by just a few thousand.

It’s been called the Dubai of northern China, showered with wealth, packed with public infrastructure and located near to precious natural resources in a region plagued by water-supply troubles.

Ordos is a ghost town located in Inner Mongolia. Seeing the potential of this city in terms of spots we decided to organize a skate trip and be the first ones to skate such a surreal place.

I'm a shy, awkward guy. I was dropped in the middle of the wintry Italian alps of Friuli Venezia Giulia, left to wander and experience whatever lay ahead. I met stranger after stranger who greeted me with a glass of wine and open arms; smiles as big as the mountains we conquered. They took me on a journey I will never forget. The interest they had in making sure I got out of my shell and had the experience of my life is so unheard of. In such a short period of time these strangers became family, untangling my shy soul and packed in the audacious and inspiring life I have always been journeying toward. What a happy and beautiful people.

2209,50965265,The Greatness HD,"“THE GREATNESS” BY YI ZHOU

SOUNDTRACK PERFORMED BY ENNIO MORRICONE AND YI ZHOU

The Greatness is Yi Zhou’s latest 3-D animation video, another step in her continuing research on the boundaries between dreams and reality, imagination and madness, truth and lies, and life after death.

Ms. Zhou is inspired once again by Dante’s the Divine Comedy. Her imaginary journey through the circles of Hell, Purgatory and Paradise appropriates specific images, scenes, and characters from her earlier work : Pharrell Williams and the bridge from the video The Ear (2008); The fountain frozen in an other-worldly realm of ice from the video Paradise (2007) and the image of the beating heart from My Heart Laid Bare (2006) and places them in a new and extraordinary environments. These juxtapositions and re-imaginations transform the artist’s original reference and meaning into something completely new and different in The Greatness, and these new realities are given a sharp and almost tactile immediacy by the artist’s adroit manipulation of 3-D technology. 

Music is a central character in The Greatness. The video begins with the notes of a mysterious waltz-like rhythm, and the soundtrack itself directs attention to the special collaboration between the artist and the Oscar-winning composer Ennio Morricone. This is the second collaboration between Morricone and Ms. Zhou. Morricone’s exploration of the emotional vibrations of sound under a various states of fear, pleasure, exaltation and mystery, and his use in this piece of segments of previously unpublished melodies and sounds from his personal archives, are both an extension of his professional pro-occupation with “object and subject fusion” and a perfect complement to Ms. Zhou multilayered visual style in her films and animations. The haunting melodies are reminiscent of the soundtracks Morricone composed for Dario Argento’s first trilogy of movies.

The Greatness was produced by Contrasts Gallery, and as a partnership among MK2 and Yi Zhou.
It was recorded in the studio Morricone in Rome in early 2010.",2012-10-08T02:23:43-04:00,311568116,387,45360751,29,76911,1370,https://i.vimeocdn.com/video/315412601_780x439.webp

2222,50670586,LUMINARIAS - Dir. Tom Haines,"Director: Tom Haines
Producer: Ilduara Lamas & Tom Haines
Exec Producer: Tamasin Glasson & James Studholme
Original Soundtrack: UNKLE

Runner: Miguel Costa

Luminarias is a short visual documentary that mixes powerful images captured during the two day “Luminarias” fiesta in San Bartolome de Pinares, Spain, with a rich soundtrack comprised of an original UNKLE score, location sounds and a reading of the Rafael Alberti poem “Galope”. 

Using grainy 16mm film, Luminarias portrays the drama, confusion and traditions of the event in a painterly way, while the multi-layered collage of sound design and music and text render the drama of the fiesta. The festival takes place every January and involves “cleansing” horses and their riders as they pass through burning pine brush. Horsemen and women of all ages from infants to octogenarians take part in the purification and despite the dramatic, sometimes scary images Haines has captured here, accentuated by slow-motion photography, there is an overwhelming sense of pride, respect and care that the villagers have towards their animals, as one rider said “Luminarias is something from another world, for me a horse is a King, I understand and love horses”.

Galope by Rafael Alberti

Las tierras, las tierras, las tierras de España,
las grandes, las solas, desiertas llanuras.
Galopa, caballo cuatralbo,
jinete del pueblo,
al sol y a la luna.

¡A galopar,
a galopar,
hasta enterrarlos en el mar!

A corazón suenan, resuenan, resuenan
las tierras de España, en las herraduras.
Galopa, jinete del pueblo,
caballo cuatralbo,
caballo de espuma.

¡A galopar,
a galopar,
hasta enterrarlos en el mar!

Nadie, nadie, nadie, que enfrente no hay nadie;
que es nadie la muerte si va en tu montura.
Galopa, caballo cuatralbo,
jinete del pueblo,
que la tierra es tuya.

¡A galopar,
a galopar,
hasta enterrarlos en el mar!

Translation

Land, Land, Land of Spain, 
The large, the lonely, the bleak plains,
Galloping, white-footed horse, 
Cavalier of the people, 
under the sun and the moon.

Galloping! 
Galloping,
until they are buried in the sea

As a heart it sounds, resounds, resounds
the land of Spain, in its horseshoes.
Galloping, cavalier of the people
white-footed horse,
Horse of the surf.

Galloping!
galloping
until they are buried in the the sea

Nobody, nobody, nobody, there is nobody ahead; 
death is nobody if it rides on your saddle
Galloping, white-footed horse,
Cavalier of the people
the land is yours. 

Galloping!
galloping
until they are buried in the the sea!

I was only 19 when writing/directing the film, and it was my first experience running a full scale production. Safe to say the journey altered the course of my life, and I'm infinitely grateful for everyone who joined our merry crew of dreamers and made this unusual story a reality.

2241,17090753,NYT – Circle Squared,"Circle Squared is a commissioned animation for the New York Times' 'T Magazine'. It was released around the holidays as part of a series of shorts that explored the theme of 'Giving'.

The story is told through stop-motion animation, using toy-like hand-made wooden forms. The shapes interact similarly to the way Russian dolls nest. These cube-animal shapes originate from the idea of a box containing a gift, but instead of depicting a literal gift-giving situation, the story is rooted in the cycle of nature, where animals end up unwittingly giving of themselves so that other creatures may live.

2248,42803967,Amphitrite - Underwater Goddess,"Director Damien Krisl had the creative vision to visualize a deity. Beauty, weightlessness, mystery and art were key aspects of the concept. The objective was to mix the elements of fire and water.
It was intended to create strong contrasts. On one side the deity had to have the beauty, femininity and delicacy of a seahorse and on the other side the strength and evilness of a dragon. 

In ancient Greek mythology, Amphitrite was a sea-goddess and wife of Poseidon. Under the influence of the Olympian pantheon, she became merely the consort of Poseidon, and was further diminished by poets to a symbolic representation of the sea.  The clip shows the invocation of the goddess.

2275,46960140,Hug You Like Koalas,"Download song: http://simonpanrucker.bandcamp.com/track/hug-you-like-koalas

IMPORTANT!
Koalas can find it very stressful and exhausting to be handled by humans, so if you want a hug you should wait for the koala to make the first move. It's just simple etiquette.

More facts about koalas:

1. Koalas have a very low metabolic rate which means they have to conserve energy by sleeping for around 20 hours a day.
2. Koalas are not bears, they are marsupials of course.
3. The best Youtube comment I found while looking for koala videos was this: 'I WANT TO FEED A KOALA A SANDWICH END OF DISCUSSION'

(Koalas only really eat eucalyptus leaves so it probably wouldn't want that nasty old sandwich, but it's a nice image.)

I used a lot of videos from Youtube and Vimeo to make this. By way of crediting them, here is a list of videos used in the order they appear:

A joint collaboration with rock / ambient / experimental band MONO (www.monoofjapan.com), Legend takes you on an epic 12 minute visual and aural journey through Iceland's breathtaking landscapes during the time of the midnight sun. 

The film travels across Iceland, from the floating blue icebergs of Jokulsarlon's glacial lagoon to the steaming geothermic vents of Myvatn, the colorful mountains of Landmannalaugar to the breathtaking sunsets on Snaefellnes Peninsula, and the barren volcanic landscapes of Askja to the vast fields of lupin near Husavik.

Legend was shot over a 2 week period in June 2012 when the sun barely sets below the horizon and you never see darkness. It was filmed completely in 5K resolution using Canon full frame DSLRs on motion timelapse equipment from Kessler Crane.

Mono's score of the same name, Legend, is from their upcoming album ""For my parents"". Its edgy cinematic and epic quality helps describe Iceland - a breathtakingly beautiful yet unforgivingly dangerous place. 

The album is available for pre-order: http://www.monoishere.com/2012/07/30/pre-order-for-my-parents-now/

We would like to thank the following supporters for making this film possible:

Kessler Crane: www.KesslerCrane.com
Glacier Rental Car: www.glaciercarrental.is

Special thanks to Egill Agustsson and Adalsteinn Petur Karlsson of Husavik for their help with my car problems on Iceland National Day. It's the country's biggest holiday and they helped me get back on the road so I could continue filming.  

Last but not least, a big thank you to fellow filmmaker Joe Capra (www.scientifantastic.com) for his guidance and inspiration. His tips and advice were invaluable in helping me prepare for this trip.

Congratulations Curiosity on your superb landing at Gale Crater, Planet Mars, your new home, my heart skipped a beat for a few moments!!! Please follow Nasa’s Mars Science Laboratory Mission at http://mars.jpl.nasa.gov/msl/ for the latest news and amazing stuff :)

The Nasa rover called ‘Curiosity’ has finally arrived at Gale Crater on planet Mars after a 154 million miles journey, hurtling towards the Mars at over 13,000 mph. The main aim of Curiosity is to see whether the environment of Mars once held the ingredients of life and so Curiosity will drill into the rocks and soil and analyse samples. It is one of the most fascinating events of our recent times and a giant step forward in space exploration, enjoy :)

Visit us online: http://WWW.WEAREALLRADIOACTIVE.COM

We Are All Radioactive is an episodic documentary film created by San Francisco-based journalist Lisa Katayama and TEDTalks creator Jason Wishnow. It tells the story of a community of young surfers who are helping to rebuild a small coastal town destroyed by the tsunami in Japan in March 2011. Motoyoshi was a secret surf spot for ocean enthusiasts from Sendai. When the tsunami swept away the people and buildings there, a team of young surfers drove out to the coast, pitched tents on unaffected patches of land, and started helping generations of fisherman become entrepreneurs so they could spearhead their own reconstruction projects and develop new business ideas. 

Seven short themed chapters make up Season 1. Half the footage is shot by our team, and the other half is shot by the locals themselves. The first half of the series was entirely crowdfunded. All the episodes are subtitled in Japanese and English.

2312,45642553,Si Begg: Permission To Explode,"Si was producing his first full studio album in 7 years after focusing on virtually every other conceivable format and output of music. Being a very personal and important part of his musical evolution Si contacted us to collaborate on the new visual material that would be needed to promote the album.

Brief
Less of a brief than an overall theme to inspire the project. The concept, and title of the album, are representative of how Si views his personal work, how he channels the deepest waveform generating corners of his mind into a controlled explosion of unique self expression. Breaking out of the order and patterns of everyday life, Si views his artistic musical output as his own personal ‘Permission to Explode’.

Approach
Not a music video as such, more an experimental short intended to visually embody the sonic direction of the album. The challenge was to embrace the concept of hyper-creativity and attempt to harness this with just the right amount of rhythm and order.

Our approach was to marry the multi-layerd, eccentric, characteristics of the album with an equally rich and complex approach. Drawing on a mixed media palette we combined 3D scanning, projections, stop motion, scripting, live action & CGI with the aim of creating a unique aesthetic in the true spirit of the project.",2012-07-12T10:18:24-04:00,415380417,123,41791991,57,101680,1623,https://i.vimeocdn.com/video/290214874_780x439.webp

http://www.v.co.nz/#the-motion-project

We created and designed the live visual spectacle with a music video being produced from the results. We wanted it to be clear that the technology was real and actually being played live. The interface plays a key role in illustrating the idea of the instrument and we designed it to highlight the audio being controlled by the dancer. Design elements like real time tracking and samples being drawn on as they are played all add to authenticity of the performance. The visuals are all created live and the music video is essentially a real document of the night.

A short documentary by David Beriain.

12min. 

Synopsis:

The wind roars. The sea crashes against the cliff. Two meters of rock, that is the strip of water and oxygen where the goose barnacle grows. Two meters where the sea shows no mercy, and beats with millenary strength. A line of waves and foam where Serxo and his comrades fight for a bite out of the sea.

A line between bravery and fear. Between recklessness and common sense. Two meters without margin of error. That is where the barnacles live. Where Serxo lives. 

SEA BITES is the battle against the sea from some warriors that don't consider themselves heroes.

2339,40524878,Robbie - A Short Film By Neil Harvey,"Set 6000 years the future, Robbie charts the existential reflections of an aging robot drifting alone through space on the last of his battery life.



About the film:
I am Neil Harvey, a director and editor from Sydney, Australia.  This video is a short film I created as an anniversary present for my girlfriend a few months ago.  

The film-making process involved downloading about 10 hours of footage from the NASA archives and compiling a list of shots which resonated with me at some level.  I did this over about 2 or 3 months when I had the spare time.   From there, I put these selected shots on an editing timeline and watched them back until characters and narratives began developing in my mind.  That is when i met Robbie.

A lot of people have read 'Robbie' as a rather sad story.  My personal reading is that I find it to be a bit more uplifting, perhaps even celebratory.  While it was not my intention to have ""a message"", I was certainly interested in the way we confront death and the issue of not ever waking up again.  I also felt that by transposing such themes onto an AI character, it would provide a much more compelling vehicle through which to explore these ideas than if we were watching a human protagonist.  I'm not sure about anyone else, but I definitely find value in my life by occasionally thinking about how lucky I am that I was actually born at all.  I guess this is why I find the film to be more cathartic than depressing.

My biggest thank you to all the talented film-makers and animators at NASA.  Also, thank you to Jason Sondhi and the rest of the Vimeo team for their continued support of independent film-makers across the world.

Title

bARCODE BAND




Description

We had an experimental work where we assigned a sound of a musical instrument to a trivial barcode that we see every day, and with the sound, we were able to create a harmonious piece of music. The ‘Barcode Band Music Box’ we produced includes barcodes, formed by computer graphics, and the barcode reader. When the graphics of the barcode, which is printed on the music box, are scanned by the reader, the recognized barcode will reproduce its own sound of the musical instrument.




Objective

Ever since the society has shifted from analog generation to digital generation, inputting diverse information into two-dimensional graphic designs, such as barcodes and QR codes, has become part of our everyday life. This digital instrument called ‘Barcode Band Music Box’ is not just a new type of musical instrument. It is an instrument that communicates through the language of music. Therefore, a person can conduct music using only the barcode reader without a musical instrument. The making of the music box was composed of several different teams taking part as sound and video, design of the box, and the design of the graphics inside the box.







A band performance using a barcode reader

The BARCODE BAND, unlike the information base edited material contained in part1, is an interactive image which uses maxmsp and a bar code reader. As an attempt to go beyond the paper format of the edited material, we attempted to express an image of freely enjoying the digital by using the visualization and auralization of the bar code.




As we enter into a digital society of bar codes and QR codes, the act of containing various information in 2D graphics is becoming routine. We add the sounds of instruments to bar codes that only marked price data, and we now can create music by combining the various sounds of instruments. The bar code band music box we created include graphics consisting of bar codes and the bar code reader. When the bar code graphic printed on the music box is scanned with the reader, the scanned bar code materializes the inherent sound of the instrument contained to produce music.







The significance of the datamation of the digitial society

This new digital instrument prints out in a single sheet the existing heavy instruments so that the users of music box can make bands perform wherever they wish. The bar code band music box is in itself a communication tool which communicates through music, and people without instruments can conduct the band using the bar code reader.




The video was broadcasted in various overseas media including design boom and domestic magazines and stations after being selected as Vimeo STAFF PICK which is a rare occurrence for a Korean. Subsequently, it was performed in exhibits and performance halls which were based on the existing barcode band project.

For more information check out www.philippartus.com/snail/idea.php

A snail invents the wheel and goes through a cultural evolution to finally get back to its origin. 
A laser animation is projected at an angle of 360° onto a column, so that the audience has to walk around to follow the course of the snail. The projection surface is of a phosphorescent material, which creates an after-glowing trail that fades out slowly.

2346,45075681,HECTOMETER - World Record,"My new class giving a peak at my creative process! skl.sh/matty

This is the visual poem of William Trubridge's world record freedive to 100 meters (one hectometer, basically one football field length and back) in order to bring light to the plight of the world's smallest cetacean, the Hector's Dolphin of New Zealand. With one breath of air and diving without weights, fins or any propulsive assistance, William descended to 101 meters in the waters of Dean's Blue Hole, Bahamas, the deepest blue hole in the world.
This short documentary of the record attempts to transmit what it is like to freedive deep beneath the surface, and how we can return to explore our potential as an aquatic mammal in the search to help our endangered cousins of the seas.

2347,43732205,The Secret Number - Full Film,"""The Secret Number"" is a short sci-fi (ish) psychological drama that was created over a period of two years by a team of young filmmakers from the Savannah College of Art and Design.

http://secretnumber.colinlevy.com

Based on the short story by Igor Teper, THE SECRET NUMBER is about a man whose world is thrown into question.  Psychiatrist Simon Tomlin (Daniel Jones) has a troubling conversation with one of his patients - a brilliant mathematician named Ersheim (Tom Nowicki), who intends to prove the existence of a secret integer between three and four.  Ersheim's delusion compels Tomlin to dig deeper, but he only uncovers more questions -- about fate, connection… the nature of reality.

This is a compilation of moments captured between 2007 and 2010.

I was always greatly impressed with David Hockney's joiners. They seemed to capture so much more of the ""moment"" than conventional photography.

I started playing around with video joiners in 2007, about the same time Photoshop allowed you to layer video clips. They seemed like nice little snatches of time, so I pretty much continued shooting them throughout most of 2007 and 2008 when the mood struck.

2369,44025740,Waltz for One,"A lone astronaut on an endurance mission is forced to cope with an intrusive force which threatens to derail the operation.

During the space race of the 1960's, the Soviets and Americans were at each other's throats, vying for a foothold in galactic exploration. Simultaneous to the superpower's struggle, a wealthy eccentric by the name of Arthur Whitman set out to search for his own stellar glory. His self-financed voyage would see him try to break the record for the longest single-manned space mission, and remain in orbit for 1 week.

This is a story of one man's struggle against the forces of nature, and the more powerful forces that lay within his own psyche.

In this cyclical fairy tale, a man and a woman are cursed to be forever apart. We never see them inhabit the same space but yet we feel that there's a connection between them. One common element is that they both have the power to transform into animals. But when they do they are compelled to hunt down and destroy the other. They become blind to their passions and are overwhelmed by their instincts.

Technique: Most of the rough animation was prepared in Flash along with the corresponding color fill layers. The drawings were then printed, traced, and cleaned up on paper to achieve a more organic quality. They were then re-scanned and composited in After Effects. Some of the drawings were etched on acetate and rubbed with ink. The backgrounds were a combination of paintings, collages, and photos. The animation was rendered in HD and transfered to 35mm film.

They built it for CWI's exposition ""Turings Erfenis"" in honor of the centenary of Alan Turing's birth on 23 June 1912.

Alan Turing was a brilliant mathematician who helped define the theoretical model of the computer as we know it today. He was a visionary, one of the few people of his time who recognized the role the computer would play for humanity.

The Turing Machine (1936) is an adequate model of a computer. It can do anything the computers of today or tomorrow can do.",2012-06-17T14:54:01-04:00,79634790,143,41783612,43,72340,1419,https://i.vimeocdn.com/video/296053599_780x439.webp

A permanent installation directed by Romain Tardy & Thomas Vaquié 
Hala Stulecia, Wroclaw, Poland.

-> Be sure to watch the making of the piece here: https://vimeo.com/41475403

_________________________


When opened, Hala Stulecia was the largest reinforced concrete structure in the world. With a diameter of 65m it was home to the largest dome built since the Pantheon in Rome eighteen centuries earlier. 

The piece proposed for the Centennial Hall of Wroclaw is based around the notion of timelessness in architecture, and the idea of what future has meant throughout the 20th century.

Taking the 1910’s as a starting point (the dome was erected in 1913), historical and artistic references were used to reveal the architecture of the space.
By using references such as Fritz Lang’s Metropolis or the utopian projects of Archigram to confront the different visions of the future at different times, Romain Tardy and Thomas Vaquié were interested in trying to create a vision of a future with no precise time reference. A timeless future.

Budget was 45k euro - for the shoot. Visual effects budget was a grand total of zeeero. I designed Blinky, modeled him in 3D and played both the his voice and the body mocap performance. And did most of the VFX. Thankfully all footage of me in the skintight mocap suit has been permanently destroyed.

2376,35565030,Chasing Space,"So we have this process, called life, it's aware of itself, it's aware of itself through you, you are an instrument through which the Universe looks at itself.
The Universe is looking at itself through you, and because of this there is always an aspect of itself that it can't see.

Like a snake pursuing his own tale.

That's what we find as we investigate the Universe:
Make the microscope bigger and bigger, and we will find ever more minute things;
Make the telescope bigger and bigger, and the Universe expands, because it's running away from itself;

It won't do that if you don't chase it!

You cannot take the whole of it, but you can get rid of it!

People around you will do the utmost to persuade you that you are missing something, because they are missing something and they think they are getting it, through a certain way; and therefore, to assure theirselves, they like you to do it too!

New media art duo SWEATSHOPPE aka Blake Shaw and Bruno Levy are back from Europe with a new video that showcases their live interactive video wheatpaste in Berlin, Bristol, Belgrade, London and Paris. Over a two week period the duo pasted their videos in over 10 spots including the Berlin Wall, Les Invalides, Cordy House and even constructed a 5 meter telescopic electronic paint roller to create a two-story tall video painting in Bristol.

Video painting is a technology the duo developed that allows them to create the illusion that they are painting videos onto walls with electronic paint rollers they built. It works through custom software that they wrote that tracks the position of the paint rollers and projects video wherever they choose to paint, allowing them to explore the relationship between video, mark making and architecture and create live video collages in real time.

2389,43397805,FOR HIRE! – BANGALORE RICKSHAW,"Green, yellow, black. They are the blood in the veins of Bangalore: the 450.000 rickshaws and their drivers. Knocked together from bits and pieces, decorated, ready for the junk heap or carefully maintained like antique cars, the vehicles are as charismatic as their owners, who brave the monstrous traffic of this metropolis daringly, sleepy, chattering or stoic, making sure the passanger's trip from A to B will be full of memorable experiences.

Based on days of riding around in rickshaws and drawings made locally, this animation captures the tough workaday life of a rickshaw driver, seen through the eyes of a European visitor.

An intimate portrait of Omar, a 17 year old stranded in a refugee camp since the 2011 war in Libya.
The film offers a unique perspective of one person amongst thousands waiting for a chance to start their life again in a safe country.

When war broke out earlier this year in Libya, thousands of refugees from countries such as Somalia, Sudan, and Eritrea, who were living in or transiting through the country at the time, were forced to flee for their lives yet again. They are now waiting in refugee camps along the Tunisian and Egyptian borders - unable to return home due to war or persecution, unable to return to Libya due to ongoing violence and discrimination, and unable to stay in Tunisia or Egypt, countries both undergoing their own political upheavals.

Lyrics: 
I’m a man on fire
Walking through your street
With one guitar
And two dancing feet
Only one desire
That’s left in me
I want the whole damn world
To come dance with me

(ohhhhhhhh. Come dance with me)

I’m a hunter at bay
Come and set you free
Over heartache and shame

I wanna see our bodies burning like the old big sun
I wanna know what we’ve been learning and learning from

Everybody want safety (safety love)
Everybody want comfort (comfort love)
Everybody want certain (certain love)
Everybody but me

I’m a man on fire
Walking down your street
With one guitar
And two dancing feet
Only one desire
That’s left in me
I want the whole damn world
To come and dance with me

(bah bah bah bah bah…)

Yay, yay. Come dance with me
Over heartache and rage
Come set us free
Over panic and strange

I wanna see our bodies burning like the old big sun
I wanna know what we’ve been learning and learning from

Everybody want romance (romance love)
Everybody want safety (safety love)
Everybody want comfort (comfort love)
Everybody but me

I’m a man on fire (he’s a man on fire)
Walking down your street (walking down your street)
With one guitar (With one guitar)
And two dancing feet (two dancing feet)
Only one desire (one desire)
That’s still in me (that’s left in me)
I want the whole damn world (I want the whole damn world)
To come and dance with me (come and dance with me yeahhhhh…)

The Opening Titles for OFFF Pescara & Webfest 2012 were created in a true Physalia spirit, striving to find new ways to move a camera in reality with a control only possible in CG. This time around, we created our biggest rig ever- a multi-sized orbital crane half human-powered, half computer controlled. The different sizes of our rig allowed us to engage in a multi-dimensional trip- from the macro shots taken inside the Lightbox, to the highest flights in the woods.

The Titles were shot in stopmotion with an infrared camera hacked by ourselves- more than 10.000 raw infrared images compose them. The final film has no CG imagery and was shot entirely in stopmotion.

Ken Burns On Story Transcription

 

You know the common story is one plus one equals two, we get it.  But all stories are really, the real genuine stories, are about one and one equaling three.  That’s what I’m interested in. 

We live in a rational world where absolutely we’re certain that one and one equals two, and it does.  But the things that matter most to us, some people call it love, some people call it God, some people call it reason, is that other thing where the whole is greater than the some of its parts, and that’s the three. 
Oh great story, they are everywhere. There are millions of them!  Abraham Lincoln wins the Civil War and then he decides he’s got enough time to go to the theater.  That’s a good story.  When Thomas Jefferson said we hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, he owned a hundred human beings and never saw the hypocrisy, never saw the contradiction, and more important, never saw fit in his lifetime to free any one of them.  That’s a good story.  You know the stories that I like to tell are always interesting because the good guys have really serious flaws and the villains are very compelling.  My interest is always in complicating things. 

Jean Luc Goddard said cinema is truth 24 times a second.  Maybe.  It’s lying 24 times a second too, all the time, all story is manipulation.  Is there acceptable manipulation?  You bet.  People say oh boy, I was so moved to tears in your film.  That’s a good thing?  That was, I manipulated that.  That’s part of storytelling.  I didn’t do it dis-genuinely, I did it sincerely, I am moved by that too, that’s manipulation.  Truth is we hope a byproduct of the best of our stories and yet there are many, many different kinds of truths and an emotional truth is something that you have to build.  

I made a film on baseball once and it seemed to me that there was a dilemma for the racist of what to do about Jackie Robinson.  If you were a Brooklyn Dodger fan and you were a racist, what do you do when he arrives?  You can quit baseball all together, you can change teams, or you can change.  And I think that the kind of narrative that I subscribe trusts in the possibility that people could change.  I hope it’s a positive version of manipulation, but I do think that we do coalesce around stories that seem transcendent. 

I don’t know why I tell stories about history I mean there’s kind of classic dime-store Ken Burns wolf-at-the door things, my mother had cancer all of my life, she died when I was 11, there wasn’t a moment from when I was aware, two-and-a-half, three, that there was something dreadfully wrong in my life.  It might be that what I’m engaged in, in a historical pursuit is a thin layer perhaps thickly disguised waking of the dead, that I try to make Abraham Lincoln and Jackie Robinson and Louis Armstrong come alive and it maybe very obvious and very close to home who I’m actually trying to wake up.  We have to keep the wolf from the door, you know, we tell stories to continue ourselves. We all think an exception is going to be made in our case and we’re going to live forever, and being a human is actually arriving at the understanding that that’s not going to be, story is there to just remind us that it’s just okay.",2012-04-24T17:53:46-04:00,1180483941,321,43180571,111,145161,2690,https://i.vimeocdn.com/video/319433572_780x439.webp

The entire film was shot on Zeiss CP.2 lenses courtesy of Carl Zeiss (http://www.zeiss.com/cine/cp2). The opening title sequence was shot entirely on the new Lensbaby 80mm Tilt Shift Lens (http://www.lensbaby.com).

2435,42108559,our first Share project. Old Skool Cafe,"this year we launched Share, a stillmotion effort to give back. every year we'll donate our time and gear to tell a one story that could use our help to get a wider audience or recognition. if you'd like to nominate somebody for our next share film, please email us at share@stillmotion.ca

getting to know so many of the people that make up Old Skool showed us a world that few of us had ever experienced first hand. it was certainly my first time visiting the projects and you can immediately feel the environment as you enter. 

as you'll see in the film, what we were left with was such a warm portrait of these youth who put so much of who they are, and so much heart into making Old Skool a success. i can remember being in that age range, not quite 20 yet, and i don't think i could point to one thing that i care about half as much as these youth care about Old Skool. their perspective and determination at such a young age is absolutely awe-inspiring. 

last Friday we brought a projector down to Old Skool to premier this piece. among a packed restaurant, Teresa stopped the kitchen and had everybody come out and take a moment to share in the experience. Tammy's first reaction to the film, through tears, was especially touching. she said that the Old Skool family means so much to her and the film showed the world how she knows each of them to be in her heart. 

///////////////////  soundtrack selection

for the soundtrack we needed music that was at first quiet and contemplative, and later uplifting.  originally we thought something with piano would work great for the first chapter, but it didn't feel perfect for the tone of the piece - while it filled the quiet need,we still felt the contemplative aspect was missing.

we've always been a fan of Drew Barefoot's music because of the contemplative nature of the music - you can't help but reflect on your own life as you listen to it.  Enjoy The Calm filled both needs perfectly - it's both quiet and contemplative.  when you watch this film, you feel a sense of calm in the characters as they talk about their past experiences; they've come to terms with who they were, and now they're looking at who they are and who they are going to be, and the title of the track and the music therein couldn't have been more perfect. 

for the uplifting chapter, we turned to Kelli Schaefer's - Song For a Friend.  the music, while uplifting, isn't over the top - it felt perfect for the emotional tone of the second chapter of the film and the lyrics couldn't have been better suited to the piece - I'm just going to stand by your side, I'm just going to hold your hand tight - it's exactly what Old Skool is about and it couldn't have been any more perfect for the end of the their film.

2451,41169610,across the ocean.,"scenes i recorded on my 7D while on a goodwill program in Japan in February of 2012. 

We were able to walk around what remains of the Tsunami devastated township of Minamisanriku in the Tohoku region.  I recorded audio from two ladies who shared with us firsthand their story of struggle and survival. 

The Kanji at the start of the film reads ""ichi-go ichi-e"", which can be translated to ""once in a lifetime"".  I learnt this phrase near the end of my trip by another member of the program.  I think it captures the experience. 

The editing was inspired by the visual storytelling style of vimeo hero Matty Brown.. With a mix of my own too i suppose..!
You can view his work here : https://vimeo.com/matthewbrown

A big thank you to the Japanese Government for running such a successful program such as JENESYS over the last 5 years.  I will always remember my time in Japan.

2461,41074044,Visualtraveling - 'Kim Il-Sung's Birthday Party',"Traveling to the Hermit Kingdom is already bizarre enough, but when we heard that North Korea would be celebrating the 100 year anniversary of the Great Leader & eternal president, Kim Il-sung, there was no way to let such an epic birthday party slip through our hands.

Laurence Keefe, Kirill Korobkov and I flew over to Pyongyang for two days to witness the madness. While skateboarding within the DPRK was our main intention, it was overshadowed by the celebrations & the 'no sliding' anywhere rule.

The three minute clip portrays a small insight into North Korea from the 15th of April 2012.

Lights Ibiza II

Using the new generation of cameras I've Been Able to do this timelapse, a video made up of long-exposure pictures, joined together to show the movement of stars, clouds, shadows, all making a real acceleration of what happens in Many hours , to see Them in seconds.

99.9% of the video it s been done at night time, With The help of LED lamps, to illuminate rocks, trees etc ... When There Was no moon, I used Exposures from 30 to 40 seconds, Taking About 2:30 hours to do a sequence, But It's better When you see the stars and constellations.

I have also used the moonlight to do shorter exposures because the moonlight can be quite bright, depending on which phase is on. Some of the shots look like they have been done during the day. When you shot under the moonlight the exposure can be from 15 to 8 seconds and can take up to 1.15 hours, so I could shot the moviment of the shadow over the rocks, the moviment of the clouds during the night … 

The pictures were all made With A Canon 5D Mark II and Canon Used lenses 16-35mm, Canon 24-70mm, Canon 24mm, Most Of Them Were Made at F/2.8, ISO 1600, 3200, 6400.

All the pictures are real, it looks like They Are too many stars. This is Because the human eye can not catch much light at night. The camera movement Has Been made by two types of sliders, the ""Dynamic Perception"" and the ""Pocket Slider"" where the camera moves A Few millimeters photo by photo, Creating this movement. This is all controlled by a small computer the MX2 Arduino Controller.

Most of These Have Been Made with shots the company of my friend Alejandro Iborra, sharing the Same hobby, Knowing That going out at night and spend long hours in very remote places and apologetic to get Into it, is some kind of risky business, Sometimes I Had to go out on my own and i got some fright.

And of course thanks to my wife and Alejandro Iborra's Wife for Letting us enjoy this hobby.

All pictures are made in the island of Ibiza, this is my birth place, a wonderful place to take pictures in their most beautiful spots, caves, beaches, mountains etc ... Where You can discover a different side of Ibiza than most people have never seen .


Luces de Ibiza II

Utilizando la nueva generación de cámaras fotograficas he podido  hacer este timelapse, un video compuesto de fotos de larga exposición, que se unieron para mostrar el movimiento de estrellas, nubes, sombras, todo con una aceleración real de lo que sucede en muchas horas , para poder verlo en cuestión de segundos.

El 99,9% del vídeo se ha hecho en la noche, con la ayuda de lámparas led, para iluminar las rocas, árboles, etc ... cuando no había luna, he usado las exposiciones de 30 a 40 segundos,tardando  2:30 horas para hacer una secuencia de 10 segundos, pero es cuando mejor se ven las estrellas y constelaciones.

También he fotografiado con  la luz de la luna para  realizar exposiciones más cortas, debido a que la luz de la luna ilumina en gran medida dependiendo de su fase, algunas de las tomas  parecen que están hechas durante el día, cuando se fotografia  con la luna  la exposiciónes son  de 15 a 8 segundos y tarda alrededor de 1: 15 horas, asi pude captar el movimiento de la sombra sobre las rocas, el movimiento de las nubes en la noche, etc ...

Las imágenes fueron hechas con una Canon 5D Mark II y he utilizado los objetivos de Canon 16-35mm, Canon 24-70mm, Canon 24mm, la mayoría de ellas fueron hechas en F/2.8, ISO 1600, 3200, 6400.

Todas las fotos son reales aunque parezca que hay demasiadas estrellas esto es porque el ojo humano no puede captar tanta luz en la noche. El movimiento de la cámara ha sido hecha por dos tipos de railes, el ""Dynamic Perception"" y el ""Pocket Slider"", donde la cámara se mueve unos pocos milímetros foto a  foto, para dar esa sensacion de  movimiento. Todo esto es controlado por un pequeño ordenador  el MX2 controlador Arduino.

La mayoría de las mis salidas han sido con la  compañía de mi amigo Alejandro Iborra, que comparte la misma afición, ya que salir solo por la noche y pasar largas horas en lugares muy remotos y dificiles es algo peligroso, aunque a veces he salido solo y me he llevado algun susto.

Y por supuesto gracias a mi esposa y la esposa de Alejandro Iborra de por dejarnos disfrutar de esta afición.

Todas las imágenes son creadas en la isla de Ibiza, donde he nacido, un lugar maravilloso para tomar fotos en sus lugares más bellos, calas, playas, montañas, etc ... donde se puede conocer un lado diferente de Ibiza que la mayoría de la gente no sabe.",2012-04-11T01:36:45-04:00,268025963,167,41302739,31,73255,1950,https://i.vimeocdn.com/video/329195774_780x439.webp

SYNOPSIS:
Anne and Amir are an unlikely pair. Amir is an escalator attendant by day and aspiring sculptor by night. Even though he has never sculpted anything before, he hopes to one day fulfill his lifelong dream of making a marble bust of Charles Barkley. Anne comes from a well-to-do family and just started law school where she spends most of her days studying. Against the odds they decide to move into a shabby 300 square foot apartment and try to start a life together.

But things don’t exactly go as planned. The combination of their small apartment, their threateningly charming neighbor next door and unexpected visitors from the past make them realize that maybe they aren’t as perfect for each other as they previously had thought.

2489,38796123,"THE ARMY OF LUCK, OR THE GLOBAL PURSUIT OF HAPPINESS","The Maneki Neko (jap., literally Beckoning Cat; aka Lucky Cat, Money Cat) is a common Japanese figurine which is believed to bring luck, attract customers and bring prosperity. The Lucky Cat waves with the raised left paw and holds a historic coin in front of itself with the right one. The Lucky Cat as talisman and selling product is wide-spread in Asia and meanwhile almost all over the world.
Luck is associated here with monetary and material prosperity.
For tourists the Lucky Cat became a kind of pop style Manga character which appears in growing numbers in western private households. As kitschy-petite like exotic souvenir it refers to a certain idea of western lifestyle.
The material element of the installation»The Global Pursuit of Happiness, or: The Army of Luck« is the »Lucky Cats' Matrix«. It contains 520 shiny golden XXL Lucky Cats made of plastics which are arranged in 40 rows and 13 columns on a ramp-like stand made of aluminum (W 8 m, H 3 m, D 2 m). 
Visitors experience the Lucky Cats' Matrix as a dot-matrix display which consists of 520 waving paw grid points as its »pixels«. In each cat a servomotor is built in to control the paws move exactly in position and speed. 
The visitors are requested imaginarily by the cats to interact as users: ""Your concept of happiness is our lucky command. Write it on the keyboard"". 
Words and sentences up to 40 characters can be put in and are displayed clearly visible with the paws letter by letter as sliding text marquee. So to say, the users »choreograph« the Lucky Cats performance wordwise. Literally it is the »inscription« of an idea of happiness or a wish in the Lucky Cats' bodies by moving their paws forward and backward.
For users, the Lucky Cats become multiplied »avatars« in the world of chance and happiness. But the Lucky Cats are also able to perform spontaneously as well: they can show 25 different salutatory and signalizing gestures as well as mass movements like the »Mexican Wave« or an ecstatic »hyperkinesis«. Every displayed sentence triggers audio events – sound samples of mass or group events, like entertainment shows, political speeches, demonstrations, sport events, parades, accidents, etc. from the beginning of the last century until today. The sounds express auditorily different states of mind, like joy, euphoria, desire, fear, hate, aggression and resignation, astonishment, outrage, pain, panic, desperation and fanatical excitement. The sounds are played in random order and unpredictable combinations. Different contexts and changing settings are emerging.
Are the Lucky Cats »one-armed bandits«? Or is it a gesture in the context of a political or religious movement? Is it a just a happy waving of the fun-loving, hedonistic society? Or is the assembly of Lucky Cats a revolutionary deployment of »wish machines« as »army of luck« or is it just another marketing campaign?
The lined up, gold-reflecting mass of the Lucky Cats in the matrix appears almost as an insubstantially copy-paste-animation. The Lucky Cats in the matrix as an industrial made product become an »ornament of the masses« for repetetive-stererotype and globalized-industrialized ideals. Do we need more and more Lucky Cats to generate more and more prosperity for more and more people?

2490,39871515,It Gets Better,"a Visual Essay by Eli Guerron...

(play it full screen and with sound)

First off, I would like to thank you for watching this short film, entitled ""It Gets Better.""

This film is a visual poem, one that focuses on the hard times every single one of us has gone through in the process of discovering who we want to be, dry patches in the journey of finding out who it is we really are...

Isolation. Desolation. Courage. Endurance. And in the final moment, grasp of self-realization, represented in simple elements of visual design.

I have been working on this short for months, and one of the nicest moments I've experienced
was on 10/12/10, when I listened to Joel Burns give a speech encouraging those who suffer dire situations to remember one thing- ""it gets better"".

Listening to Joel, I realize that this film might not change the situation. It might not end suffering or change the mentality of the perpetrators, but what it CAN do is help the perpetrated to become stronger, arming them with a positive attitude and a resonant hope for the future.

I would like to thank Joel Burns for his inspiration, and to all our silent collaborators.

Please feel free to contact me at itgetsbetterfilm@gmail.com if you're interested in screenings,
or if you would like to get a higher version of this file for your own postings or sharing on your websites.

Remember to thank those who are still fighting, still strong, still walking that beautiful journey
and discovering themselves... As I leave, all I can say is, ""It gets better""...

In the memory of those who are no longer at our sides, fighting for us... in our hearts.

""...it gets better...""

Noisy jelly is a game where the player has to cook and shape his own musical material, based on coloured jelly.

With this noisy chemistry lab, the gamer will create his own jelly with water and a few grams of agar agar powder. After added different color, the mix is then pour in the molds. 10 min later, the jelly shape can then be placed on the game board,and by touching the shape, the gamer will activate different sounds.

Technically, the game board is a capacitive sensor, and the variations of the shape and their salt concentration, the distance and the strength of the finger contact are detected and transform into an audio signal.
This object aims to demonstrate that electronic can have a new aesthetic, and be envisaged as a malleable material, which has to be manipulated and experimented.

2511,21347521,America's Dead Sea,"Deep in the desert of southern California sits one of the worst environmental sites in America—a former tourist destination that has turned into a toxic soup: the Salton Sea.

The sea was born by accident 100 years ago, when the Colorado River breached an irrigation canal; for the next two years the entire volume of the river flowed into the Salton Sink, one of the lowest places on Earth. The new lake became a major tourist attraction, with resort towns springing up along its shores. Yet with no outflow, and with agricultural runoff serving as its only inflow, the sea’s waters grew increasingly toxic. Farm chemicals and ever-increasing salinity caused massive fish and bird die-offs. Use of the sea for recreational activities plummeted, and by the 1980s its tourist towns were all but abandoned.

The skeletons of these structures are still there; ghost towns encrusted in salt. California officials acknowledge that if billions of dollars are not spent to save it, the sea could shrink another 60 percent in the next 20 years, exposing soil contaminated with arsenic and other cancerous chemicals to strong winds. Should that dust become airborne, it would blow across much of southern California, creating an environmental calamity.",2011-03-22T10:44:15-04:00,61077480,213,40351643,41,49960,2113,https://i.vimeocdn.com/video/278785807_780x439.webp

2526,28922655,Synchronize,"SUMMARY
Synchronize is a tribute to the powerful effect movies can have on our imagination. This short film takes the viewer through the dream of a videostore clerk whose vision is formed by the movies he sees and hears.

CONTEXT					
Synchronized is made for everybody who witnessed and loved the 80s and its awesome movies. But also a reminder to those who look down upon hollywood that even their imagination is most likely to be shaped by the ""american"" cliches of yesteryears.
				
RESULT				
Synchronize has struck a cord with many viewers who grew up in the 80's and is likely to touch even more people. The more movies you can recognize the more fun this short film gets.

Benjamin's travel dream was to hitchhike around the USA for a year (his Nana thought it was a pretty curious dream as well).

He wanted to meet people from all walks of life and learn about the world through a simple adventure.  

The video took 3 months to shoot and 2 years to create (although Benjamin's a hitchhiker and wasn't slaving away for 12 hours a day or anything :).

2530,20249114,ED'S STORY It Ain't Over,"In It Ain't Over, the first film in the Ed's Story series, Ed Dobson reminds us that life isn't over yet and that we don't have to feel overwhelmed by the struggles we're facing today. Difficult news can sometimes make us feel like our lives are over. Ed shows us that we don't know the future, and that things may turn out quite differently from what we expect. www.edsstory.com",2011-02-22T11:56:47-05:00,387329540,587,39157873,132,244917,3237,https://i.vimeocdn.com/video/270484758_780x439.webp

Tilt :
The hotel Au vieux panier asked me to design a room, I first told them that I wasn't interested doing just decoration in the room but I wanted
to create something that will look more like an installation. I thought about it also as a huge canvas where I needed to think about the composition
and play with the empty white part of the room to accentuate more the idea of Chaos on the other part. Then I asked my friend Tober who gat a great
old school style for tags, Grizz who is also the man behind the camera and Don Cho who is a Hip Hop singer from Marseille but who used to be
a tagger from my home town Toulouse. It took one week to do the whole thing cause the idea was to exaggerate what you can usually see in some
abandoned places. Too much tags, too much drips, too much sentences, too much throw ups ... What I also wanted to show is that people can appreciate
any type of graffiti, even the more basic, it's just a matter of point of view ...

Mise en scène, Hand, Hand Painting: Virgilio Villoresi
D.O.P.: Alan Grillo Spina

Fine is the story of birth, life and death of a soldier, represented on a hand (mine, for instance).
The movie is inspired by the concept of handpainting and the finger videos movement. Dedicated transitions created with the technique of the shuft pan has been used to create a true cinematografic editing through the hand.
both the initial and final soundtrack, as well as the military salute of the last scene are a hommage to Jiri Trnka's masterpiece ""The Hand"".

2553,37597693,FITC Amsterdam 2012 Opening Titles,"We started with the theme of personality in social media at first. After narrowing it down and let it match with FITC we took it into the direction of the creation process. We wanted the viewer to be sucked into the mind of a creative. Show his roller coaster of emotions in his process. We contacted creative writer Tifene Huchet to write the story. She shaped Sam, a man that dreamed about discovering the universe since he was a little boy and is driven by it till this day.

After creating a moving storyboard and treatment a lot of people became enthusiastic and joined us to fight the deadline (2 1/2 weeks from there on). With guys working from Sweden & Los Angeles, Skype was a real invention! We divided scenes, so everybody could do his own bit. With rendering and compositing done at our studio we could match the final look and created it as a whole. We aimed on creating a film noir look with its typical lighting and be very subtle with adding color.

Studio Takt did an amazing job (again!). He finished it in only 4 days. We're surprised how he achieved to glue all scenes together smoothly.

Thank you guys, we think it was a labour of love!

2555,37548094,Matchstick,"Matchstick, the song, is by American Royalty, a new trio out of Los Angeles.  Matchstick, the video was painted in water colors and water soluble crayons on 3 foot long, three inches thin strips of paper. The style grew out of paintings I make for a pre-cinema Praxinoscope, which grew from experiments with painting on film. Matchstick was mostly painted frame at a time under a digital camera mounted on a traditional animation stand with a mechanical stage which was used to keep the paper moving. The idea was to paint and draw abstract visuals which could dance along to the psychedelic song by the band .

2556,37388088,PRISMATICA,"Prismatica consists of an arrangement of pyramid-shaped crystals affixed to an LCD screen and illuminated with programmed geometric animation. The animated patterns are precisely mapped to the vertices of the crystals, illuminating them individually and in formation. The animations are further refracted through the geometry of the crystals in accordance with the shifting perspective of the observer, which in turn alters the way the illuminations appear and interact with reflections of surrounding lights within the space. 

This piece acts as an extension of the visual and perceptual experimentations of my immersive installations.

2564,36753544,GAMMA,"SYNOPSIS
In a post-nuclear future, when the earth is riddled with radiation, a new urban developer proposes to regenerate the cities back into civilisation. GAMMA sets out to stabilise the atomic mistakes of yesteryear for the re-inhabitation of future generations. Using its patented 'Nuke-Root' technology; part fungi, part mollusc, GAMMA intends to soak up the radiation and remove it from the irradiated cities, rebuilding them in the process.

Setting out from Baikonur, Kazakhstan, GAMMA launches its RIG_01 BETA and heads east to the iconic disaster sites of 1980's USSR. The film follows a group of researchers investigating GAMMA's practice from launch to deployment. Moving through a trail of unsuccessful ships across the desert, we follow the researchers from Aralsk's littered sea bed east to the Ukraine. 
 
GAMMA begins its quest of nuclear stability in the Ukraine; Pripyat is used as a test bed for the deployment of GAMMA's patented 'Nuke-root' organisms. Intended to soak up the radiation, the roots infiltrate the ground and built structures to absorb the ‘nuclear nasty's'. As with many urban developers, GAMMA's execution is cheap and ineffective. The city is in turn rendered more radioactive, broken and uninhabitable than before, only now with an outbreak of growing 'Nuke-roots'. The film follows the researchers through the ruins of the 70's utopia, moving across a whole city that consists solely of desolation and total abandon, the researchers witness the aftermath of GAMMA's almighty cock-up.


GAMMA was filmed in the Ukraine and Kazakhstan in association with the Unknown Fields Division.

Finally I finished ""CYCLE"", the short I was working on the last couple of weeks, the practical part of my B.A. Thesis.

I visualized a life cycle by using abstract shapes which are inspired by particular elements and processes in nature. These different elements are combined and brought together into a new context.
One of the main goals was to let the film end just where it started, that the narration becomes a closed circle.

Our system of law doesn't acknowledge the derivative nature of creativity. Instead, ideas are regarded as property, as unique and original lots with distinct boundaries. But ideas aren't so tidy. They're layered, they’re interwoven, they're tangled. And when the system conflicts with the reality... the system starts to fail.

Story: A solitary, one winged creature called Wing is harassed by a group of oppressive crows due to being weak and different from them. He decides that he wants to overcome his disability and escape from the forest. He builds a catapult and a mechanical wing to accomplish this. When he launches himself away from the forest, the wing malfunctions, and he crashes into the territory of the crows. The crows are about to harm him, but are then lured away by a two-winged humanoid, who the crows attack instead. Wing finds the creature, and discovers it is a female of his own kind, and that the crows have torn one of her wings off. As the crows come towards them, Wing gets the idea that he and the female can fly in tandem by flapping each of their single wings while holding onto each other, and they manage to escape from the forest.

2605,36071497,Vanessa Bruno - Moonlight,"Une fille stellaire, une fille solaire qui s’accroche à la lune et débarque sur une terre inconnue, un sol non foulé, immaculé comme sa tenue blanche.

Est-ce la fin du réel, le début d’un rêve ? 

Le nouveau film Vanessa Buno réalisé par Stéphanie Di Giusto offre un visage, celui de Kate Bosworth.
Elle habite une maison irréelle, posée là dans le désert d’un espace temps improbable, où tout devient possible, comme défier l’apesanteur et le temps.

Son passé ressurgit. Il est léger et inconscient : une main d’enfant qui caresse son visage, une piscine sous le soleil de la Californie, des rires, des vies.

Kate fonce et ne se retourne plus, il y avait les souvenirs et maintenant il y a l’horizon, l’avenir à inventer, à imaginer, comme dans un conte futuriste.
Elle se révèle enfin à la lune, telle une jeune femme messie illuminée d’une pensée tellurique.

Au-delà de cet onirisme, le film est à l’image de la collection Vanessa Bruno, une candeur de ton dont l’enveloppe – la douceur nacrée des vêtements – s’exile au-delà des contingences du quotidien.

Un style, une mode en guise de protection solaire contre une grisaille environnante dont la silhouette et le visage de l’actrice Kate Bosworth rayonnent d’espoir. 

Un film en apesanteur où l’imaginaire règne et sauvegarde une pureté que rien n’entrave. Une fille la tête dans la lune, qui s ‘accroche à ses rêves. Ou direction les étoiles ?

//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

A stellar girl, a radiant girl who clutches onto the moon and arrives in an unknown land, on unmarred ground, as immaculate as her white ensemble.

Is this the end of reality, the beginning of a dream?

The new Vanessa Bruno film directed by Stephanie Di Giusto presents a face, that of Kate Bosworth.

She lives in an illusory house, set in the desert of an improbable space-time where anything is possible, whether weightlessness or challenging the course of time.

Her past resurfaces. It is airy and subconscious: a child's hand caressing her face, a swimming pool in sunny California, laughter, life.

Kate rushes forth and doesn’t look back, there were memories and now there is the horizon, a future to invent, to imagine, like a futuristic fairy tale.

She finally reveals herself to the moon, like a young woman messiah illuminated from within by telluric thoughts.

Beyond its dreamlike nature, the film is a reflection of the Vanessa Bruno collection, a candor of tone in which the shell – the pearly softness of the clothes – is exiled beyond the contingencies of everyday life.

A Style, a mode of dress in lieu of sunscreen against the surrounding somber grayness from which the silhouette and the face of actress Kate Bosworth radiate hope.

A weightless film where imagination reigns and safeguards a purity that nothing can hinder. A girl with her head in the clouds, who clings to her dreams. Or on towards the stars?",2012-02-02T05:14:14-05:00,146383421,128,36888803,55,75548,1289,https://i.vimeocdn.com/video/253182618_780x439.webp

2012

Surface ii – Surface ii is an experimental moving image work focused upon several concepts.  In one sense it is a visual experimental journey that discovers and plays with the notions of the celluloid surface, the ways specifically it can be physically manipulated.  In another sense it is a study of image and sound, every visual detail is paired with its own unique sound sample which creates an almost hypomanic sensation where even the smallest detail takes on a new sense.  The work also questions decay in a literal sense but also beyond the surface, the degradation of a medium and a time.",2012-01-27T23:52:55-05:00,472897621,126,36595206,50,67390,1048,https://i.vimeocdn.com/video/251039246_780x439.webp

of Lost & Found Films (lostfoundfilms.com).

Prime Burger Restaurant, in Midtown Manhattan
For many of the guys that work here, the restaurant is like a second home - some of them have been slinging burgers, making shakes, and waiting on customers at this location for decades.  Opened in 1938, the place hasn't been altered since the early '60s, and it looks all the better for it.

Here the waiters and workers of Prime Burger discuss their views on their chosen profession, and the unique nature of the place itself.

THIS MUST BE THE PLACE

There's no place like home. It's where we live, work and dream. It's our sanctuary and our refuge. We can love them or hate them. It can be just for the night or for the rest of our lives. But whoever we may be, we all have a place we call home.

THIS MUST BE THE PLACE is a series of short films that explore the idea of home, or places that function as home - workplaces, hang out spots, etc.  We want to figure out what makes them, how they represent us, why we need them. 

We're always on the lookout for dwellings of all sorts. If you've come across any curious or eccentric homes or other curious places, feel free to send them along.

2619,34072719,Slug Invasion,"Bachelor film project 2012 from The Animation Workshop.

Story:
As morning dawns on a Norwegian suburb, a detachment of killer-slugs, led by the notorious Sergeant Slug, prepare for a heads-on attack on a small garden – their objective? A juicy, delicious flower on the other end, deep within a flowerbed.
A new conscript and his close friend, a medical officer, both suit and join in the massive charge into the garden. But as the slugs emerge into the exposed field, they stand head to head with a diligent, elderly lady, hell-bent on keeping her garden pristine and safe from pests. 
As the two sides clash, it is as the saying goes: All's fair in hunger and war!

Jack’s tenacious spirit and ingenuity will either keep his family together or he'll lose everything trying.

2634,34948855,Star Wars Uncut: Director's Cut,"Finally, the crowd-sourced project has been stitched together and put online for your streaming pleasure. The ""Director's Cut"" is a feature-length film that contains hand-picked scenes from the entire StarWarsUncut.com collection. 

Many thanks to Aaron Valdez (video editor - http://www.aaronvaldez.com) and Bryan Pugh (sound design/mixing - http://bryanpugh.me) for the countless hours they put into this masterpiece.

The Story:

In 2009, thousands of Internet users were asked to remake “Star Wars: A New Hope” into a fan film, 15 seconds at a time. Contributors were allowed to recreate scenes from Star Wars however they wanted. Within just a few months SWU grew into a wild success. The creativity that poured into the project was unimaginable.

SWU has been featured in documentaries, news features and conferences around the world for its unique appeal. In 2010 we won a Primetime Emmy for Outstanding Creative Achievement In Interactive Media. 

We can't thank everyone enough for making this such a special project.

2635,30203159,Ten by Ten | Bluebrain,"Hornet director Gabe Askew premieres his music video for Bluebrain's Ten by Ten song, off of the album Soft Power. The band approached Gabe after they saw his unofficial music video for Grizzly Bear’s Two Weeks. Offered full creative license, and spanning a period of six months, Gabe developed our CG hero as he navigates through a surreal environment. Gabe drew upon the events happening in the nation during the economic crash to create an enigmatic narrative.
 
With the recession directly affecting Gabe's own life, this video explores the themes of hard work and perseverance in moments of crisis. At the time of the video’s creation, Gabe was in between day jobs and at the same time garnering a mass influx of attention due to his Two Weeks video. These elements of uncertainty coupled with industriousness influenced the journey of the main character in the music video. With hope and optimism as a foundation for this video, Gabe has taken us on a mysterious quest beyond time and money, and out of the chains that bind our hero.

2639,31100268,PROTECT IP / SOPA Breaks The Internet,"Tell Congress not to censor the internet NOW! -  thecenterforrights.org/pipa

PROTECT-IP is a bill that has been introduced in the Senate and the House and is moving quickly through Congress. It gives the government and corporations the ability to censor the net, in the name of protecting ""creativity"". The law would let the government or corporations censor entire sites-- they just have to convince a judge that the site is ""dedicated to copyright infringement."" 

The government has already wrongly shut down sites without any recourse to the site owner. Under this bill, sharing a video with anything copyrighted in it, or what sites like Youtube and Twitter do, would be considered illegal behavior according to this bill. 

According to the Congressional Budget Office, this bill would cost us $47 million tax dollars a year — that's for a fix that won't work, disrupts the internet, stifles innovation, shuts out diverse voices, and censors the internet. This bill is bad for creativity and does not protect your rights.",2011-10-25T14:22:40-04:00,171663388,260,35786089,52,74045,1571,https://i.vimeocdn.com/video/245075560_780x439.webp

Driving tirelessly through darkness in search of perfect daylight, only to watch it fade to orange and slip away again. We searched and discovered new ways to befriend this wonderful place, danced blind and drunk on the snowy streets of Reykjavik. We collaborated on the score with our friend and newest member of the collective Edo Van Breemen, who collected snippets of sound and lyrics from the landscape, transforming the entire journey into a recording studio. We worked together, played together, ate together, and (somehow) returned home together.

Мурманск — очень красивый город. Мурманск построен на бесчисленных холмах, поэтому при езде по ночному Мурманску из окна автомобиля иногда открывается совершенно фантастический вид: горящие окна зданий и фонари автотрасс выстраиваются в сказочные террасы, напоминающие пейзажи из фантастических фильмов.

Кроме холмов у Мурманска есть еще одна особенность — незамерзающий залив. С одной стороны, жить ""у моря"" — это романтика. С другой стороны, по рассказам аборигенов в Мурманске иногда морозы за тридцать градусов стоят по паре недель. А минус тридцать при влажности сто процентов и при пронизывающем северном ветре — это, доложу вам, конкретная пытка.

Также в Мурманске есть такое явление, как полярная ночь: пара месяцев в году, когда солнцу просто лень просыпаться и высовываться из-за горизонта, чтобы погреть лица мурманчан. В молодом возрасте, говорят, это не очень важно, а вот после пятидесяти сверхдлинные ночи начинают раздражать.

Впрочем, кроме полярных ночей в Мурманске случаются и полярные дни: те же петербургские белые ночи, только намного белее. А за возможность любоваться северным сиянием, уверен, климату Мурманска можно простить некоторую суровость.

Во время войны через Мурманск шли поставки техники от наших союзников. Фашистам, разумеется, это активно не нравилось. Многочисленные бомбардировки разрушили город практически полностью, однако врагам так и не удалось захватить его. В честь этих памятных событий на самом видном месте Мурманска был воздвигнут исполинский, тридцатипятиметровый памятник Алёше.",2012-01-06T14:00:54-05:00,221628271,197,34724990,71,65299,978,https://i.vimeocdn.com/video/243276567_780x439.webp

2659,32282580,Locomotive - Place des Arts - Espace culturel,"“Locomotive”, the most recent addition to the mosaic screen installation in the foyer of Place des Arts, is a fantastical portrayal of a human machine.

The context resembles an elaborate organic dominos game.  It begins with a musical impulse and is accompanied by an inexorable advancement of light.

Human flesh makes up a patchwork of glittering metallic members - which have the luster of new pistons and bolts - engendering a hybrid mass.

Caught in awkward tension, the bodies quiver in suspension, the movement becoming increasingly intense until released by the passing impulse.

 The carefully synchronized three-dimensional chain reaction of image, sound and light dehumanizes the body while simultaneously makes us smile.  Uncomfortable yet intrigued, the eye of the passer cannot turn away from the machine.  The complexity of the work lies in its ambiguity of being funny, monstrous, and sensual all at the same time.

The totality of this intriguing puzzle is best seen by taking a step back.  However, in order to observe and appreciate the detail of the movement, it is equally engaging to advance forward.  Each gear, wheel and suture plays its role to tie the whole piece together.
 For this project, in lieu of creating a work that is intrinsically promotional, Place des Arts has taken the risk of acting as a sponsor and distributor of this purely artistic and cinematic endeavor.
 
Conceived with the intention of using the proposed space - its limitations and constraints – in the pursuit giving life to a custom made creation, “Locomotive” highlights the artistic potential of the mosaic screens in the foyer.

Un jeu de domino organique qui se met en marche sous l’impulsion de la musique et l’avancée inexorable de la lumière. 

Les corps en tension, fébriles et tressaillant s’activent, leur mouvement s’amplifie et s’intensifie jusqu’au relâchement qui suit le passage de la vague. 
Le patchwork des membres métalliques et luisants comme autant de pistons et de boulons suffisent à engendrer cette machine hybride, sans autre accessoire que la chair.

La réaction en chaîne tridimensionnelle –image, son, lumière- minutieusement synchronisée, déshumanise les corps tout en nous faisant esquisser un sourire. Mal à l’aise et intrigué, l’œil du passant ne peut se détourner de cette machine à la fois complexe et drôle, monstrueuse et sensuelle. 
On se recule pour embrasser du regard la globalité de ce casse tête intrigant, avant de mieux observer les détails de chaque rouage, de chaque mouvement, de chaque suture. 
On peut en rire; on peut également en frissonner.
Pour ce projet la Place Des Arts a pris le risque d’agir à titre de commanditaire et de diffuseur d’une pièce purement artistique. 

Elle a coordonné et appuyé cette œuvre cinématographique non pas dans le but de véhiculer un message promotionnel mais pour mettre en valeur la mosaïque d’écrans, pour utiliser l’espace proposé -avec ses limites et contraintes- et donner vie à une création qui l’épouse parfaitement.

INSPIRATION:

The Imaginary Foundation says ""To Understand Is To Perceive Patterns""...

Albert-László Barabási, think about NETWORKS: 

“Networks are everywhere. The brain is a network of nerve cells connected by axons, and cells themselves are networks of molecules connected by biochemical reactions. Societies, too, are networks of people linked by friendships, familial relationships and professional ties. On a larger scale, food webs and ecosystems can be represented as networks of species. 

'For decades, we assumed that the components of such complex systems as the cell, the society, or the Internet are randomly wired together.

Steven Johnson, author of Where Good Ideas Come From, writes about recurring patterns and networks:

“Coral reefs are sometimes called “the cities of the sea”, and we need to take the metaphor seriously: the reef ecosystem is so innovative because it shares some defining characteristics with actual cities. These patterns of innovation and creativity are fractal: they reappear in recognizable form as you zoom in and out, from molecule to neuron to pixel to sidewalk. Whether you’re looking at original innovations of carbon-based life, or the explosion of news tools on the web, the same shapes keep turning up... when life gets creative, it has a tendency to gravitate toward certain recurring patterns, whether those patterns are self-organizing, or whether they are deliberately crafted by human agents”

“Put simply: cities are like ant colonies are like software is like slime molds are like evolution is like disease is like sewage systems are like poetry is like the neural pathways in our brain. Everything is connected.

""...Johnson uses ‘The Long Zoom’ to define the way he looks at the world—if you concentrate on any one level, there are patterns that you miss. When you step back and simultaneously consider, say, the sentience of a slime mold, the cultural life of downtown Manhattan and the behavior of artificially intelligent computer code, new patterns emerge.”

Geoffrey West, from The Santa Fe Institute, 

""...Network systems can sustain life at all scales, whether intracellularly or within you and me or in ecosystems or within a city.... If you have a million citizens in a city or if you have 1014 cells in your body, they have to be networked together in some optimal way for that system to function, to adapt, to grow, to mitigate, and to be long term resilient.""

Author Paul Stammetts writes about The Mycelial Archetype: He compares the mushroom mycelium with the overlapping information-sharing systems that comprise the Internet, with the networked neurons in the brain, and with a computer model of dark matter in the universe.  

""Adrian Bejan takes the recurring patterns in nature—trees, tributaries, air passages, neural networks, and lightning bolts—and reveals how a single principle of physics, the Constructal Law, accounts for the evolution of these and all other designs in our world.
 
Everything—from biological life to inanimate systems—generates shape and structure and evolves in a sequence of ever-improving designs in order to facilitate flow. River basins, cardiovascular systems, and bolts of lightning are very efficient flow systems to move a current—of water, blood, or electricity.

2689,32851562,Mike & Christie - Proposal,"After a week trip down to Bentonville, Arkansas to visit my best friend (I spent 10 years in the south and with me currently living in Toronto, Ontario, Canada I don't get many opportunities to visit my old home). It was the best trip ever and we got back to Toronto on his birthday. Within 5 minutes of getting home on his OWN birthday, he gifted me with a Samsung Galaxy Tablet and when I turned it on it immediately played this animation. :) 

It was originally a flash animation, so when it asked me the big question it has ""Yes"" & ""No"" buttons on the screen. Upon pressing yes, it played the final animation after the fade. Curious to know what happen if I pressed ""No"", I went back and replayed the animation. I had Michael press no for me, and to my surprise the button moved! I guess he wouldn't take no for an answer :)

When I finished with the video he presented me with a teal Birks box and inside the most beautiful ring I have ever seen (picture bottom right). He's truly the sweetest man ever and I am incredibly lucky to have found him.

coaching: Roland Lindner - decollage.tv London

This music video was created as a non-commercial project by Laura Sahin, Astrid Neumayr and Barbara Helbich at the BETA Young Creative Lab.  After test shoots on different materials and with different types of animation they decided to make very basic abstract animations which are projected onto black cardboard cubes that are moved in the room. This way they are able to translate the dynamic of the sound into a new visual language. A three-dimensional look could be achieved that makes you wonder if the video is ""real"" or a product of 3D computer animation. Rather important was the conclusion at the end with the three of them moving the cubes and letting everything end in a colorful chaos. 

Something that might be interesting: there was no manipulation of the raw-footage after the shooting, the only thing that was done in the postproduction was the cutting.",2011-09-22T12:29:07-04:00,1057631307,189,33813356,123,284672,3650,https://i.vimeocdn.com/video/233045552_780x439.webp

2726,32800387,Old Black -- Egyptrixx feat. Ohbijou,"http://anf.nu/old-black/
Old Black is Egyprixx´ remake of the song of the same title by the drone doom band Earth. David Psutka had already commissioned me with the video Start from the Beginning for Egyptrixx last year and he commissioned another one this year. Even though ""Old Black"" and ""Start from the Beginning"" are completely different songs, I tried to stick to a similar concept and develop a bleak artifical world, which is influenced by the soundcsape. Starting out I had designed a lot more symbols and scenes, but David urged me to keep it as minimal and simple as possible.

The graphic elements are a mixture of 3d-renderings and flat 2d textures aligned in space. The video makes heavy use of particles and simulations and was made with the open source 3d software http://blender.org with After Effects used for particle and compositing work. Randomness finds its way into my work often and I appreciate the element of not having complete control over the outcome of a scene.
The video was made in a timeframe of about 3 weeks total, with render and simulation times well over 6 weeks spread out on several workstations.",2011-11-28T14:06:30-05:00,189713382,245,33401864,27,58778,855,https://i.vimeocdn.com/video/226714550_780x439.webp

Filmed  by www.greenrenaissance.co.za (https://www.facebook.com/greenrenaissance)  for WWF South Africa

Black rhino given new home

The seventh black rhino population established by the WWF Black Rhino Range Expansion Project, was recently released after an epic 1500 kilometre trip across the country. 19 of the critically endangered animals were moved from the Eastern Cape to a new location in Limpopo province.

“This was possible because of the far-sightedness of the Eastern Cape Provincial government who were prepared to become partners in the project for the sake of black rhino conservation in South Africa,” said WWF’s project leader Dr Jacques Flamand. “The operation was difficult due to the number of animals and the long distances involved. But wildlife veterinarians, conservation managers and capture teams from WWF, Eastern Cape Parks and Tourism Agency, SANParks and Ezemvelo KZN Wildlife worked cooperatively to ensure the success of the translocation. We all learned from one another and were united in a common cause.”

“We are a young organisation and this is a great opportunity to be giving something back to the national conservation effort,” said Dave Balfour, conservation director of the Eastern Cape Parks and Tourism Agency. “We are excited about getting ourselves integrated into national conservation. A critical element of future conservation success will be the ability of agencies with a common interest to work together. This was a great example of that.""

A relatively new capture technique was used to airlift some of the rhinos out of difficult or inaccessible areas by helicopter. This entails suspending the sleeping rhino by the ankles for a short trip through the air to awaiting vehicles. “Previously rhinos were either transported by lorry over very difficult tracks, or airlifted in a net. This new procedure is gentler on the darted rhino because it shortens the time it has to be kept asleep with drugs, the respiration is not as compromised as it can be in a net and it avoids the need for travel in a crate over terrible tracks,” explains Dr Flamand. “Another advantage is that rhinos can be more easily removed from dangerous situations, for example if they have fallen asleep in a donga or other difficult terrain after being darted. The helicopter translocations usually take less than ten minutes, and the animals suffer no ill effect. All of the veterinarians working on the translocation agreed that this was now the method of choice for the well-being of the animals.”

Security of rhinos is a major concern given the current poaching onslaught. Project partners receiving rhinos on their land are only chosen if their security systems are of a high standard. “Translocating rhinos always involves risk, but we cannot keep all our eggs in one basket. It is essential to manage black rhino populations for maximum growth as it is still a critically endangered species and this is what the project does by creating large new populations which we hope will breed quickly,” concludes Dr Flamand.

The WWF Black Rhino Range Expansion Project aims to increase the range and numbers of black rhino in South Africa and has created seven significant black rhino populations in eight years. Close to 120 black rhino have been translocated to date.",2011-11-09T04:08:20-05:00,154229781,208,28717516,15,24341,357,https://i.vimeocdn.com/video/295677900_780x439.webp

2763,31112081,"""The Game of Things"" by Cristian Straub for Ethel Vaughn","Short Film commissioned by Hamburg fashion brand Ethel Vaughn.
 

ABOUT
 
“As I stared up into the bright blue sky that was near the end of what felt like a trillion years, I was visited by a horrible sense of claustrophobia. A claustrophobia that sets in only when no space is great enough to contain you. Cause you have all this stuff inside you that refuses to leave. All those useless stupid things from the past.”
... a female voice whispers in the beginning of the film.
Things talk relationships. This is the premise for THE GAME OF THINGS, Cristian Straub’s latest fashion short film for German fashion label Ethel Vaughn. A woman is haunted by her past, by things and moments she once shared with someone. As the film unfolds
we get a grasp of the romantic relationship that is no more. The woman is determined to clean up her life - by setting all the ""useless, stupid things"" from the past on fire. In the meantime, a mysterious rider appears. And it looks like he’s up to no good...

Once again, director Cristian Straub was joined by director of photography Jakob Suess in his journey for new forms of visual expression. Heavily inspired by the cinema of the late 60s & early 70s (like Nicolas Roeg’s “Don’t look now” or Polanski’s “The Tenant”), they crafted a film that emanates not only the aesthetic feel, but also embraces the courageous spirit and the cinematic curiosity of that particular era in film history.
For THE GAME OF THINGS Fashion Film House Riese Farbaute teamed with Metrosafari Locations, both aiming to set new standards in forward thinking fashion film productions.

2765,31426899,Afghanistan – touch down in flight,"www.lukasaugustin.com
Winner of the CNN Journalist Award 2013

background:
As each of us has his own impression of Afghanistan that is predominantly marked with pictures of foreign forces, explosions and terror, we were privileged to have access to capture daily life and portrait some people of Afghanistan. 
We hope the pictures you know will  merge with the pictures you see and will enrich your view on the country in the Hindu Kush.

locations:
Kabul and Mazar-e Sharif
We wanted to go to other places as well but there were several incidents and security was too bad. Just one day after shooting at the blue mosque in Mazar-e Sharif a mob started from the very same place storming the UN building.

I have lived from 2006-2008 in Kabul doing my civil service for a humanitarian aid organization. This  March I had the chance to go back with my fiancée to show her the place I love and to capture the beauty of this country with our cameras.

At the same time I made this as a tribute to a dear friend, who was shot in the streets of Kabul. Gayle inspired me in her love and dedication for the Afghans.

After a full summer with other work we had now the chance to do the editing. 

Lisa-Maria Puy who composed the music for us was wonderful to work with. We met her on Zanzibar island and back in Germany she composed this wonderful soundtrack within just 3 days (and nights). She studied music at HfM Detmold in Germany and is a very talented artist and we hope to work with her again. 
You can contact her on: puy-music[at]gmx.de

Last week the clip got published in the iPad edition of Süddeutsche-Zeitung Magazin.

I hope you enjoy and we are happy for your honest feedback.

Every second our planet is spinning you, but you can begin to spin our world yourself. Every day you are able to go ahead in order to be happy and make happy others. Yes, it is not so simple. There are many obstacles in the way. Life is not a movie. Although it as a movie has a physical end. Nobody knows what will be in the end of our life. And while you live you are the director of each moment.
 Our new Stop Motion Animation ""I LOOK & MOVE"" about all those people who were able to turn this world, to change something, build something, create something and do something that tracks on our planet.

The Animation Hub, which received support from the Irish Film Board and Science Foundation Ireland, ran for 3 months over the summer in 2011 and involved Giant Creative working with animation and computer science students to create a one minute animated short fusing motion capture techniques with naturalistic 3D character animation.

This was funded by an Irish Film Board scheme called 'Short Cuts' and was shot in November 2007. The Budget was €70K, and was used entirely on the live action components of the film - leaving a grand total of ZERO for visual effects!

I completed all the visual effects shots, over 120 in total, entirely by myself here at Image Now Films. Dave Head modelled the aircraft (and truck), but I textured, lit, animated and composited the shots over a six month period in 2008.",2011-10-27T10:49:10-04:00,389812511,593,32273368,38,61435,1303,https://i.vimeocdn.com/video/347968476_780x439.webp

DROPLETS is a movie about ideas. But it’s mostly a movie about the feelings, when you have no idea. Oppression, disorientation and fear can be paralyzing, but are often a very important element on the way to the perfect idea. The movie DROPLETS shows this feelings in an experimental way.

A day in the life of Danny, a high school hockey defenseman. School, girls, and his next-door neighbor: hockey legend Ken Daneyko.

Starring: Josh Gutkin, the Jonathan Dayton High School Bulldogs with NJ Devils Alumi Randy Velischek and Ken Daneyko.

Writer & Director :: Larry Cohen 
Producer :: Timothy Whitney
Director of Photography :: Andrew J. Whittaker
Sound Designer :: Gregg Swiatlowski
Music :: Ryan Sciaino

The film was written during the 2010 Winter Olympics, based on a dream I had about Ken Daneyko -- who in my mind, epitomizes Ice Hockey. It features a cast of mostly non-actors, shot on location at the South Mountain Arena and Randolph, NJ. My Grandmother was a diehard Devils fan, till she passed away in 2002. The film is dedicated to her.

2791,29399425,I Need Nothing - a nearly useless odyssey,"Repositories of stories and its enriching emotions, the covers, that accomodate the existing panoply of musical genres, are the motto for this exibition. The focus is made on album covers that often conquer our memory even when music slightly reached our ears. Major graphic disasters or deified, unduly ignored or zeitgeists, covers provide listening with a touch and an image, with the act of collection and share. From cover to cover, going thru all the stories (and histories), we wrote a new one to the sound of a song that repeats: I need nothing, I’ve everything I need.

‘I need nothing’ is an original concept from Cãoceito + Burdman, shot by Moopie. Its premier happens as a tangential project of EXD’11.

‘Useless’ - the motto of biennial’s current edition - was the kick-off, and the thought on how album covers (vinyls, in this case) enable people to ‘listen with the eyes’ the main goal of the project. At a time where digital audio files dominate but where traditional mediums still seduce fans, the album covers, being useless for some, stay relevant for others.

In this odyssey we benefited from the help of a set of people which, directly or not, live by the rhythm of the music they buy, download, share or create. The Parenthetical Girls lent music (Doughnut) to the video; Moopie shot the video; Matéria Prima yielded the venue in Lisbon; designers/illustrators/artists - Ariana Couvinha, Carla Almeida, Daniel Marques, Diogo Carvalho, Júlio Dolbeth, Hugo Oliveira, Manuel F. Sousa, Mariana Fernandes, Miguel Feraso Cabral, Miguel Vale, Nuno Aguiar, Paulo Lourenço, Paulo Serra, Pedro Naves, Rodrigo Burdman, Rui Vitorino Santos e Samir Mesquita - provided the bulk of over 200 covers, which populate the video and embody the central element of the project, and yet all others who enriched the discussion with surprising texts.

Within 'Somewhere' We are transported to a time where the boundaries between what is real and what is simulated are blurred. We live online and download places to relax, parks and shopping malls. We can even interact with our friends as if they were in the same room with simulated tele-presence. Everyone is connected and immersed in nanorobotic replications of any kind of object or furnishings, downlodable on credit based systems. Distance and time become as alien as the 'offline' The local becomes the global and the global becomes the local. Consumer based capitalism has changed forever. A truly 'glocolised' world. The singularity is near. 

The film places us into this vision, observing an average inhabitant within the ever changing environment of the latest SimuHouse. From a painting to a park and from a telephone call to a shopping mall. That is until there is a leek in the system and everything malfunctions. The film concludes with the house being forced to reset, giving the character and viewer a stark reminder that nothing is 'real' even her dog, which re-materialises in front of her.

2812,29268321,"Com Truise - ""Brokendate""","Music as evocative as the stuff made by Com Truise—master of the transporting synth odyssey—necessitates videos that are nothing short of cinematic. Hence the fully blown-out treatment for “Brokendate,” which rolls everything from eighties cop noir to Blade Runner retro-futurism to slo-mo Hype Williams nods into one five-minute world unto itself.

Says previous collaborator and director Will Joines of 10 lb Pictures: “While I was cutting the ‘Fairlight’ video earlier in the year I kept thinking that it was fun, but if I ever had the opportunity to actually film something for one of Com Truise's songs then I could really go all out and create this whole world that would be specifically tailored to his music.” Mission accomplished.

ABOUT COM TRUISE
When talking about the music of Com Truise (one of the many pseudonyms of New Jersey designer/musician Seth Haley), the nostalgia bit inevitably comes up, so let's get that out of the way. Yes, his songs tap classic sci-fi and proto-electro in a way that is distinctly early eighties in scope. But they're also remarkably weird—stutter-step proggy and intoxicatingly psychedelic, like those classic touchstones got drunk on lava lamp juice inside a pinball machine. After his well-received Cyanide Sisters EP, a grip of remixes for artists like Twin Shadow, Neon Indian, and, uh, Daft Punk, and a few floating MP3s, Truise's first LP, Galactic Melt, will finally enter brainspaces this summer.

2816,29112172,RAT Vs POSSUM 'FAT MONK' OFFICIAL MUSIC VIDEO,"Lucy has developed a Summer School concept that gives students the opportunity to work directly with industry professionals on a real project whilst at school. Working alongside Melbourne’s RMIT University with architecture, fashion, media and interior design students, this three week intense Summer School offers a fresh and pragmatic framework summoning a new direction in creative education and evolution of music video.

Lucy approached Australian synth pop outfit Rat Vs Possum to see if they would be interested in uniting forces with twenty students and make a kaleidoscopic dance clip where students are the actors and actresses.

Rat Vs Possum’s Let Music and Bodies Unite is a dance-inspired party album with a music video to match! Trained as a classical ballerina and renowned as a pedigree artist Lucy creates her very own Rock Eistedford! (an Australian nationwide competition for music, dance and drama school students).

Lead vocalist Daphne Shum takes us on her journey through her two disparate worlds; whimsical dance choreographies that reference synchronised swimming and a high school science lab are some of the scenes in this fun, theatrical, orchestrated puppet show. These two realities are united by the metallic clad vocalist, Daphne driving these kaleidoscopic worlds. Acclaimed video artist Kit Webster re-projects looped footage back into these worlds to add a synth-pop undertone which perfectly befits the feel of this album.

2822,27561214,The Killing Joke,"A Short Film by Sebastian Lopez

The Killing Joke is a 15 minute suspense/fiction short film about a mysterious woman that finds a red balloon tied up to a curious little box on an eery derelict street. Using classic elements of suspense and working within a seventies aesthetic, 'The Killing Joke' is an action packed film that pays homage to some of the horror movies from that era.

The piece was shot during four intense days of filming in the Argentinian capital Buenos Aires. The micro budget production was shot using just two 7d canon cameras. The composition and CGI effects for 'The Killing Joke' required months of 'invisible' digital retouching to create the panoramic, yet claustrophobic atmosphere that pervades throughout the movie.

The Film editor was Sabrina Mottino. 

Sebastián López wrote and directed the story, and was also responsible for all the impressive post and composition work. 

Colin Devlin created the Original Soundtrack, working from his home studio in LA he collaborated on the project with Sebastian from it's inception, creating a wonderful striking symmetry between sound and image.This is the second collaboration for Sebastian and Colin, the first being an action packed trailer created for a fictitious movie called 'Vertical' that went viral on the net, creating a serious buzz for the young director.

Actors Gustavo Marzo and Clarisa Staracci Worked together to portray the intense characters seen on screen.

The Killing Joke was a work of entire dedication and effort.

Here is our new music video for Leeds/London based band Pengilly's, for their new single ""Toby's Hill"" (part of the EP of the same title). Pay as much or as little as you want to download it from their bandcamp page!

We're fascinated by cults such as Heaven's Gate, West Boro Baptist Church, Raelism, Scientology etc etc. How  charismatic, god complex individuals can have so much power over people who might not necessarily be stupid or weak, just suggestible. The band were really open to the way we wished to portray them, Ric particularly, as a spoilt ego-maniac, drunk on power over the group. 

The band were fantastic to work with - all in all shooting this video was an absolute pleasure and one of the most enjoyable shoots we've been involved in.

“Take Your Medicine” is the second single off Transfer’s debut album,“Future Selves,” slated for a September 19th release on Cool Green Recordings/Mascot Label Group. The video is Directed by Nader Husseini and produced/edited by Amy Grieshaber. Radium/Reel FX turnkeyed the spot.

The team used After Effects as the main compositing software. They combined the 2D drawings and paintings and 3D animation and digital effects into a single space in order to create a highly textured look. In addition to lighting and compositing the CG characters and props in Maya, the team used Maya Toon, Maya Hair and Maya nCloth, manipulating and merging techniques not typically used in the studio’s CG pipeline. Pre-compositing 3D components in Nuke ensured an efficient workflow. These files were also color-corrected and incorporated into the 2D environments in After Effects. Using Maya Paint FX in conjunction with cloth simulations and digital effects added to the video’s unique style.

Here's the basics:
1. Record for 20-30 mins. 
2. Go frame by frame and grab pieces of the road that aren't obstructed by a car. Eventually, you will have every piece of the road. 
3. Put the static image of the road in with the moving background.

DETUND™ 10

Kritical Audio’s newest release, Katacomb, is the long awaited follow up album to their critically acclaimed debut release “Krupp” released on the “Detroit Underground 6” record. This sophomore album from the dynamic duo hailing from Sweden will not disappoint any listener who has come to appreciate the idiosyncratic melodies and granular glitch-hop sound that Kritical Audio fans have come to expect and love. Their smash hit “Krupp”, that was recently featured in the online marketing campaign for the BLOC 2011 festival in the UK, is often likened to Aphex Twin and his quintessential bar raiser “Windowlicker”. If the eerie synth lines and deep glitched-out 303 bass lines don’t get your attention, the punchy electro rhythms and futuristic time-stretching granular percussion hits and samples will get your brain itching for more.",2011-05-05T12:17:00-04:00,113408715,341,27578410,51,174494,3236,https://i.vimeocdn.com/video/183256814_780x439.webp

2900,25092596,Robots of Brixton,"Brixton has degenerated into a disregarded area inhabited by London's new robot workforce - robots built and designed to carry out all of the tasks which humans are no longer inclined to do. The mechanical population of Brixton has rocketed, resulting in unplanned, cheap and quick additions to the skyline.

The film follows the trials and tribulations of young robots surviving at the sharp end of inner city life, living the predictable existence of a populous hemmed in by poverty, disillusionment and mass unemployment.  When the Police invade the one space which the robots can call their own, the fierce and strained relationship between the two sides explodes into an outbreak of violence echoing that of 1981.

Experimental Short, 3min 40sec

A short story about two unlikely friends saying goodbye. A young man named Charles just lost his home. He spends one last day with his best friend, a sea turtle, before moving on.

More on the making of Sayonara here;
http://vimeo.com/24676900

This graduation project was made while at the Kyoto University of Art and Design. It brings together a lot of the research I had done over the three years I spent in Kyoto, using techniques such as drawing, cg, photography, painting, video, and puppets. ""Sayonara"" is based abstractly on my own experiences living in Japan, the concepts relate in many ways to these experiences, my friends, foods, things I saw, and things I felt over this time; in particular the idea of saying goodbye to close friends.

Often referred to as a ""digital dumping ground"", millions of tons of e-waste are processed each year in Agbogbloshie

Processing electronic waste presents a serious health threat to workers at Agbogbloshie. The fumes released from the burning of the plastics and metals used in electronics are composed of highly toxic chemicals and carcinogens. Workers often inhale lead, cadmium,dioxins, furans, phthalates and brominated flame retardants.

Exposure to these fumes is especially hazardous to children, as these toxins are known to inhibit the development of the reproductive system, the nervous system and the brain.

This short Mood-Documentary is recutted from the material of the german Documentary ""Die Kinder der Toxic City"" which i shot this year as a second dop with Jürgen Steiger as the first dop with Christian Bock  
-director- in Ghana. 

This pictures are all shooted by me...

Keir Dullea encounters a mysterious object, in a scenario reminiscent of the penultimate scene from Stanley Kubrick’s 2001: A Space Odyssey that he appeared in over forty years ago.

This spec teaser/faux commercial was developed over a two year period on a shoestring budget. Live action was filmed multi-camera, against greenscreen atop a backlit plexi floor. Mr. Dullea was then integrated into an entirely digitally created CG set rendered at 1080HD.

""2011"" created, directed & 3D CG by Oliver Zeller. The Immersive Cocoon is a future concept study by Tino Schaedler with design collective NAU; an idea to push the envelope and provoke a new conception and evolution of computer interaction.

2946,23155536,F5 2011 RE:PLAY Film Festival. Inductance,"“Happy” was the theme we were given by the organizers for this year's F5 Re:Play Fest ( http://f5fest.com ), held in April in NYC, to create this edition's pieces, probably the hardest thing to convey in any artistic expression. After a good deal of introspection, and teaming up with awesome motion graphics artist Gerardo del Hierro, we decided that happy wasn't happy for Physalia unless pliers, microchips and a bit of soldering were involved, and with this idea we resolved to create the happiest machine Physalia has built to date.

Like most country musicians, Jonny spends more time on the road than on terra firma, more on stage than off, but with all that, Jonny is gaining a name for waking up daily, before and after every show, and burning ten miles while bandmates sleep off their evenings. Imagine Hank Williams Jr. from the belt up, Steve Prefontaine from the waistband down, throw in a gallon of water and a knack for showmanship, and what do you get? One of the great American vitalists, Jonny Corndawg.

Jonny let us follow him on a tour down the California coast as he braved injury and isolation on his quest to complete the Surf City USA Marathon in Huntington Beach, CA.

2953,23413966,24 Hours of Neon,"My first attempt at HDR tone mapping timelapse.

We start off with normal timelapse and then go into the 3 and 7 bracket tone mapped HDR timelapses.

I wanted to create a sense of colour and insanity that Las Vegas gives you. All from one view point. My balcony. With that restriction can you do it? Well I did it before in my two previous timelapses...

This was harder in a way as there was no single focal point like in the Sydney Harbour piece or the Space Needle piece. 

I made a virtue of the HDR tone mapping with the change of pace in the music and also my use of bookends which I love.

Moviebox is a show from Megapix channel dedicated to movie news, which delivers interviews with stars and behind the scenes curiosities.For its new identity, playing with the handmade crafts graphic feel, we have simulated a small studio scenario where tiny narratives develop around good old movies clichés, representing a variety of film genres.The box always takes central place in the scenes, and besides being the channel’s symbol, works as a starting point for the construction of the Moviebox logo as well as the structure for the graphics inside the show.The final outcome is a strong identity that engages the audience in an amusing, playful way.

The founding father of the Hospital imprint and mouthpiece of the multi-award winning, chart topping Hospital podcast, London Elektricity is a name that should need no introduction. Since starting the label in 1996, Tony Colman has carved out a fearsome reputation as one of the pre-eminent names in D&B and remains at the forefront of the scene to this day. 

This incredible 12"" release marks the first London Elektricity release for over two years and is the first single to be taken from his highly anticipated forthcoming album 'Yikes!' which is due out at the end of April. His last release 'All Hell Is Breaking Loose' stormed on to the Radio One playlist, proving his underground and overground credentials once again. A lot has changed since 2008's 'Syncopated City: 'this is my first release for 3 years, and features the vocals of Elsa Esmeralda who graced 'Just One Second' from my last album Syncopated City. Elsa features on 7 tracks on my new album 'Yikes', and I can safely say this is easily my best work to date. Yikes has been 2 years in the making, I hope you enjoy it as much as I enjoyed making it! '

Sparse and minimal, 'Elektricity Will Keep Me Warm' is UK bass music at its most soulful and imaginative. A stripped down 'think' break, 808 subs and laconic piano chords drive the main tune along with an absolutely outstanding vocal performance from Elsa Esmarelda, whose previous London Elektricity collaboration ""Just One Second"" has become a massive Hospital anthem. 

""The Plan That Cannot Fail"" on the flip side is an awesome slice of instrumental d+b magic. Get ready for hands and lighters in the air as the tune builds and evolves into a heart-rending powerhouse, built around a rich piano progression and tripping breaks. Absolutely sublime.

London Elektricity continues to be one of the finest purveyors of forward thinking, ground-breaking music and this single is a testament to his ongoing success. As the mounting anticipation surrounding the release of his album builds, all eyes are firmly fixed on the Colminator as we enter spring 2011.

Ruling a land based on a coffee plantation, a megalomanic leader is overcome by paranoïa as he often reads the future of his empire off the marks in his coffee cup. He is often shadowed by an illusory second self that visits him in warning of an exterior threat. Succumbing to his alter ego, he builds a fort around his people who finally rise up against their ruler.",2011-04-11T04:35:31-04:00,339954910,479,22875944,46,117874,1103,https://i.vimeocdn.com/video/148546551_780x439.webp

2993,21905044,X-Men: First Class Title Sequence,"Inspired by classic Sixties movie titles and prompted by John Struan of Super Punch fame, I've built a 1960s style title sequence for the upcoming X-Men: First Class film.

Set during the midst of the Cuba Missile Crisis, X-Men: First Class tells the story of the first team coming together, before they would become the heroes and villains we know from the original X-Men Trilogy.

This sequence was designed to give a very brief primer on the time period, the setting, as well as show the relationships of the characters in this film, as they are very different from the previous movies and audiences shouldn't be confused as to why Professor X and Magneto, enemies in the original trilogy, are the best of friends in this prequel.

Super Punch held a contest redesigning the posters for the film, which played it safe by sticking very close to the correlation to the original trilogy, and winding up rather mundane compared to the slick trailer rife with espionage, red fear, and 60s hair. Several people were quick to make posters in the Mod, Saul Bass, and James Bond style that I had in mind, so it was decided that I'd make a title sequence instead. 

And yes, that music is a very melancholic rendition of the 90s cartoon theme song.

Photographer John Moore is no stranger to combat. As a member of an Associated Press team in 2005, he shared a Pulitzer Prize for breaking news photography for coverage of the war in Iraq and he's done extended stints in Afghanistan, Pakistan, Somalia, South Africa, Mexico and Nicaragua and elsewhere in the last 20 years.

Yet despite his relative comfort with being on the frontlines, Moore told the NewsHour from his hotel room in Cairo that his latest assignment -a six-week trip that took him to the uprisings in Egypt, Bahrain and Libya - might have been his most dangerous. Moore recorded the interview for us after sneaking out of Benghazi, Libya en route back to his home in Denver.",2011-03-22T20:13:55-04:00,204429626,342,21194561,26,153313,1251,https://i.vimeocdn.com/video/136185616_780x439.webp

3013,21198351,Water ink _ BDDP Unlimited and Solidarités International - UK,"To mark World Water Day, on March 22nd Solidarités International and its agency BDDP Unlimited will roll out a campaign to build awareness of the scourge of undrinkable water. 

Today, it is estimated that 3.6 million people, including 1.5 million children under the age of 5, die every year of diseases borne by unhealthy water, making it the world’s leading cause of death.

Yet the public isn’t aware of it and political leaders do not demonstrate the drive it takes to end the terrible deaths. The campaign calls on journalists to spread awareness of this scourge and appeal to readers to sign a petition that will be personally handed to the French president during the 6th World Water Forum in March 2012.

To evoke the silent and invisible threat of unhealthy water, BDDP Unlimited opted for a minimalist approach that is both visually appealing and surprising, using water and ink exclusively. The spot shows the power of ink to reveal the invisible.

The spot, created by BDDP Unlimited, produced by Hush and directed by Clément Beauvais, a young director, illustrator, musician and photographer. His multiple talents and mastery of various techniques enabled him to both create the drawings and direct the spot.

The campaign will be seen from mid-March on TV, in cinemas, on the Internet and in print. A dedicated web site, www.votregouttedeau.org, will gather signatures for the petition.",2011-03-18T10:50:41-04:00,18140355,102,17597422,22,87441,1613,https://i.vimeocdn.com/video/109581872_780x439.webp

3029,20534171,Conan O'Brien Kinetic Typography,"Digital Design (Spring 2011)
Oklahoma State University
Professor Justen Renyer
Illustrator, Soundbooth, Cinema 4D, After Effects

This Kinetic Typography project was created from the dialogue of Conan O'Brien's final episode of The Tonight Show on NBC. In this farewell address, he describes his feelings towards NBC and the situation at hand. His personality exudes positivity and humor allowing this dialogue to describe his character very well. Even through the hardships of leaving NBC he promotes hard work and kindness.

The concept behind this video is to show Conan O'Brien as the monumental entertainer and solid wall that he is. Conan O'Brien is and will continue to be a seasoned television entertainer. After drawing inspiration from Lou Dorfsman's Gastrotypographicalassemblage, this concept was achieved by creating a literal wall from over 60 individual typographic layouts. These custom crafted layouts reference a variety of eclectic type design. The combination of eclectic typography and modern 3D letter forms achieved in Cinema 4D provides a contrast between old and new. This contrast emphasizes time to create a sturdy and timeless object. This solidity and timelessness is the perfect representation of Conan O'Brien.

The idea came about by wanting to play with timelapse as a way of showing different realities. The Maestro obviously sees things differently than most people and by working the timelapse effect into the narrative, it allows us to see the world from his point of view. 

The Maestro was shot in Sydney, Australia with a crew of four people on the Canon 5D Mark II using only available light. The visual effects featured were all shot in-camera and later composited in post.

The video directed and edited myself, was shot over the course of two weeks in locations around London, Wells North Norfolk and towards Paris. The concepts for the video came out of a personal response and interpretation to the music. Much like dancing to the piece for the first time, I wanted the image to move in direct accord with the beat tempo and the feel of the melody. As the volume and tension build up, I envisaged the point of view moving underground and the tangents becoming more sinister for moments. I think this feeling comes across and pictures serve the music well. 

I wanted to keep up the urgency and forward motion by using visual metaphors such as escalators, lifts, trains, gravity and wind, mechanisms we trust without being in control of motion. As the track builds it becomes richer and the melodies take you into more fluid and lucid areas. I felt it was good to introduce and dissect narratives against themselves. For example having three sequences running parallel, you could say interrupting or disconnecting each flow was a provocative way at augmenting the pulse of the music in a visual sense. I didn’t find it a problem not having a clear resolution to the phrases, and found that there is a counterpoint between natural elements and digital dimensions, which are reasonably straightforward.

1st Place - 2011 Redstone Film Festival, Boston, MA


""...a beautifully photographed and expertly edited day in the life of Winthrop lobster fisherman ploying their endangered trade. Devoid of any commentary beyond the playlist of the oldies radio station the crew is listening to, it employs the minimalist and illuminating style of documentaries like 'Sweetgrass.'""
- Peter Keough - The Boston Phoenix, 2/9/11

""...a striking film, with no dialogue, brilliant lighting and camera shots as slick as the decks the fishermen stood on. Salty Dogs is a smoothly minimalist film, where narrative is not as important as the minutiae of a day in these fisherman’s lives. The film doesn’t suffer from the lack of a solid plot; instead, its strengthened by the honest portrayal of the boredom and repetitive beauty of life on the sea.""

I've finally managed to get myself some new Nikkor lenses, and already they seem so much better then my old Minolta ones. So, I took a day off and filmed a bunch of stuff around my garden and in the forest next to my house.

Also in July 2010 I started teaching myself piano, so instead of editing to a soundtrack, I decided to play my own. It's a tad off in places, I just get a bit nervous whilst being filmed and I found it hard to keep rhythm.

synopsis

We wanted to make a series of moving sculptures that take inspiration from the great surrealists like dali and in particular his lobster telephone. We have tried to build intriguing objects that leave you wanting to see more.  These objects are mechanical but at the same time organic in their movements. They are a collection of textures, objects and movements that create images that we wanted to see.

At least that's what I wrote on the festival entry form for a film called ""Llama Cookin'"", which didn't even exist. I then started making the film but abandoned it after a few days, and changed the film's title to ""Sorry Film Not Ready"". Two weeks later I received a notification saying that the festival had not yet received ""Sorry Film Not Ready"", but that the deadline had been extended by one week. I then decided to make the film after all, in one week.

It got accepted into the festival (Ottawa Animation Festival), and has since been accepted into many others. But it's still not ready. For any festival.

//EDIT:
We're quite aware that we could have used more games or different games but we just wanted to show a small insight into the history of videogames that just shows how far we've come and where our roots are buried.
A small FAQ:
There are Playstation 1,2 and 3 devices, just pay close attention or read the credits =)
I noticed that many of you are missing the XBox and Halo on it. It was planned but my friend with the controller called me just before the day of the shooting and said he couldn't find it =( Sorry
Ecco and the dreamcast were mainly meant to show a flop in game history (please don't kill me for saying that =) ! If you have a different opinion on this one it's cool. We don't mean to insult anyone).
Why didn't we just cover...everything?!—due to the limited time that we had for this project it was hard enough to gather all controllers and output devices we used. And we're quite aware that it's not always the best possible combination of game pad and monitor =)
We didnt use XBox Kinect or Playstation Move because the technology isn't new.
And remember this is (almost) a one-shot (= no cuts used) => the more games/controllers, the harder it gets—one mistake and you can start over.
We captured a total of 45takes.

The film was instrumental in supporting director Dominic Allen's Emerging Australian Filmmaker Award at the Melbourne International Film Festival and the 2009 Inside Film Rising Talent Award. 

2009 MIFF Jury member Deb Verhoeven remarked ""Two Men proves that the simplest scenario can provide the perfect premise for conveying the most profound insights. But (Allen's) key achievement is to understand that even the largest ideas are best told with brevity and the most serious with humour.""

Two Men was made with the support of Yiriman, a community initiated and community driven project supported by the Kimberley Aboriginal Law and Culture Centre which aims to build stories, strength and resilience in the Kimberley's youth.

Then Roger Ebert fell in love with it.

He championed the short, calling it ""Man in a Blizzard,"" and said it should win an Academy Award.

It went madly viral after that and did over a million hits. It was subsequently named TIME Magazine's #3 Creative Video of 2011.

So all I've got to say is: thanks to everybody who's seen the short and liked it.

3120,18230243,ALPHABLOKS - Motion Typography,"This project was created in 2010 as a motion typography challenge.

School: Academy of Art University, San Francisco
Department: Computer Arts, VFX
Class: Compositing for Motion Graphics 2
Instructor: Colin Evoy Sebestyen

""Alphabloks""

Creative Brief:

Using the techniques we have covered in class lecture, produce 3 short videos that will function as ""motion glyphs"". I will assign you your respective letters or numbers. The free typeface from Crol.rene, ""wodenbloks"" will be our basis.

Process:

Our typefaces will be based on Crol.rene's ""wodenbloks"", however, the paths are not optimized for the creation of geometry, so you will need to retrace the paths in Adobe Illustrator, and merge them into c4d. Once in c4d, I've created a stock setup for all of the designers to utilize. It includes preset materials, a lighting setup, and a camera setup with isometric projection. You'll need to extrude your geometry with a movement of 50 in the z parameter of an extrude object. From this point forward, design an effective and eye catching animation to reveal your glyph, using the mograph module and the techniques we have covered over the course of 15 weeks. 

If you choose to use color, I've included a color palette for use and to aid with consistency. You'll have 60 frames to resolve the intro animation and then hold the animation for 10 frames. You may not use any bleed of any sort on the edges of your compositions- so no revealing elements from the edge of the screen. An example of allowable techniques might be to have elements scale, fade, or push through a boolean ""floor"". I have included guides for the ""floor"" (baseline) and a plane object for a guide of the x-height.

Also, Nonagon has provided us with 2 second audio clips which will be assigned to each letter. You may use the audio procedurally to drive your animation using the sound effector and the mograph data node if you like, or just sync it after, or sync with keyframes, the audio usage is up to you. 

This is essential for the end product, because every word we lay out will be accompanied with a different sound composition, creating a unique sound design experience with every word, with the vowels triggering more frequently.

Once you have completed the animation of your letters or numbers, group all of your geometry to a null and create a compositing tag with an object buffer enabled so that we will have a track matte for the creation of alpha channels when we bring the animations into after effects.

Using the charAt expression we have review in class in AE, a file has been generated that will drive the time remap values of your precomps so that you can type whatever you like using your glyph animation using the type object in After Effects. Audio Reverb and Delay effects have also been added on each precomp.

I look forward to your design solutions! I've assigned myself 3 as well, to join in the fun.

Technical Specifications and Outcomes:

• You must render your compositions at 800 x 800, 30 fps, with an RGBA pass and an Object Buffer pass.
• You are required to use the style guide included in the dropoff.
• You must create 3 animations, 70 frames in length
• You will be critiqued based on the technical skills demonstrated on each of the 3 animations, as well as your creativity.

Digital Files:
• Don’t forget to bring copies of the digital files you used for every assignment. These files may become valuable tools when troubleshooting files with problems. If you do not bring your files, it will not be possible to take the time to solve your problem.

Thank You!

3121,17621410,New York Times Magazine - Year In Ideas,"The Long-Life-Span Smartphone.  A great idea, as I am tired of getting a new phone every 2 years. Check out all the Ideas here http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2010/12/19/magazine/ideas2010.html

From the article:

""In the United States, a cellphone’s average life span is 18 months, and yet fewer than 1 percent of these phones are estimated to be recycled. As an antidote to this pattern of rapid obsolescence, the British design-consulting firm Kinneir Dufort developed its Revive smartphone concept, proposing a device that can evolve over time rather than be cast aside when it breaks or something newer and shinier hits the market. Unlike existing products on the market, it would be designed for easy disassembly, so the end user could replace or upgrade components without tossing the entire phone.

Service providers and manufacturers would be able to charge for these improvements, replacing revenue they would have earned from selling new phones. To help it age gracefully, Revive would be made from materials — leathers, metals and plastic composites — that acquire a patina from wear. A service subscription, meanwhile, would offer the user credits the longer he held on to the phone, making him a “stakeholder” with an investment in the longevity of the product."" JESSE ASHLOCK

The robot itself formed part of the 'Daydreaming with ...James Lavelle' exhibition along with an accompanying video sound-tracked to the instrumental re-working of ‘The Runaway’ (Lupe’s Revenge). The original track appears on UNKLE’s most recent album ‘Where Did The Night Fall’ with its vocal driven hip-hop counterpart featuring on The Answer EP.

Its splintered synths and a shuddering bass-line create an aggression and energy which Nolan harnessed within the robot’s marching stomp towards the camera.

After spending a long night in a dark, creepy warehouse full of mannequins, and many hours of spare time in front of your computer, this is what you get!

In this piece we’ve combined two of our interests, creative visuals and electro music, to create a music video for the up-and-coming Swedish artist Mille. The idea was to use projections on mannequins to achieve a different and interesting expression where graphics almost become clothes on the bodies. 

To be able to do this we got some help from a couple of friends - David Einar behind the camera and Transfett who did the live sync of visuals onto mannequins, thanks guys! Awesome work.

And our collective's website : http://steakanimation.com !

------------------------------------------------------

Buck is an ordinary guy. Well, if you accept the ""deer head"" thing.
Today, Buck is going to spend the afternoon with his girlfriend who's so happy to see him (she's pretty much happy all the time). But when Buck finds out that her father is not the tolerant and sympathetic guy he expected, the Sunday afternoon turns really bad. Really bad. Like baaaaaaad bad.


Buck est un jeune ordinaire. Enfin...si on exclut sa tête de cerf.
Et aujourd'hui, Buck compte bien passer son Dimanche après-midi avec sa petite-amie qui est super contente de le voir, comme toujours. Mais quand Buck découvre que son futur beau-papa n'est pas si sympathique et tolérant que sa fille, l'après-midi va tourner au drame.

3151,12377177,The Windmill Farmer,"A nurturing farmer in is danger of losing his crop of windmills when he struggles against the cyclical forces of nature.

Created at the UCLA Animation Workshop, with music by Nick Fevola.

This film was inspired while driving back from a trip to Palm Springs, when a friend said that it must take them forever to plant and grow so many windmills. I wrote down the title The Windmill Farmer for an idea to explore later, and about a year later I started developing it into a character and story.

This film took 4 months to complete from the first boards until the final mix.

NEW VIDEO FOR EGYPTRIXX HERE
http://anf.nu/old-black

The video examines the relationship between the simulated image and its physical manifestation. The landscape appearing in the video references one of FischerÂ´s relief sculptures (http://anfischer.com/new-relief-in-progress/).
The sculpture is magnified and distorted by the soundscape created by David Psutka. As time progresses the landscape becomes increasingly complex and distorted and finally changes its aggregate state to liquid. The shapes of the polygons appear in contrast to the fluid with which they collide.
The 3d model was textured with photos of the physical sculpture, which was carved from a block of mdf with a cnc-miling machine.

While embezzling $14 billion from a Chinese bank for the US government, two Western bankers grab $15 million in cash for themselves. They store it in an upright bass case and wander the streets of Shanghai, waiting for their morning departure. When the more experienced of the two insists they spend their last night partying in a local club, the night takes a wild turn. Goodbye Shanghai explores the negative effects of Western imperialism on modern Chinese culture.

Metal-fabricator Neil Youngberg never planned on taking over his grandfather's business and is now faced with passing on his legacy.  

In this short-form profile, Skylar Nielsen from Vita Brevis Films interviews Neil Youngberg for the beginning exploration of our ""Professional"" series.  Shot on location in Neil's metal fabrication shop, the 3rd generation craftsman gives a sincere overview of his life's work, dispensing hard-worn wisdom while illuminating the sobering realities of the role private business plays in an ever changing economic landscape. A deeply personal project for all involved, this on-going series seeks to shed-light on forgotten trades and practices in an evolving America.

3187,15925400,INTO THE COSMOS - Architeq/Chopsy,"“INTO THE COSMOS” is ChopsyAnimations (www.chopsyanimation.com) first foray into the world of music videos, a tie-in with music maker Architeq from Tirk Records.  

Originally it was conceived as a short film by Chopsy (director Darren Robbie), with a simple premise: “what happens to all the old vinyl people used to play?  From out of attics, rubbish bins & forgotten shelving, the records are summoned to an old warehouse by a mysterious ‘collector’.”

Using a combination of stop-frame, pixilation, live-action & time lapse animation, it was shot in a variety of locations around Bristol & was created by shooting entirely in camera whenever possible (at other times multiple passes were combined). By shooting each frame within a specific timescale for the external shots, we see vinyl records interacting with the ever changing natural light & weather (dry or wet, sunny or cloudy) – if you look closely you can even see puddles drying out in a couple of shots.

The short film was created on & off over a period of 7 months by a bunch of friends between paid work, a real labour of love (it had no budget to speak of). It was shot in late winter earlier this year with the spring & summer being used to do all the post (mainly rig removal). All the records you see were cut before shooting, with new centre labels stuck onto them to create the desired visual effect of them spinning & bouncing through the ground, they were then animated on location using weighted rigs.

Architeq added the music & sound effects after filming finished & the first edit was completed. Rigs were removed, different passes combined & shadows cleaned up in AfterEffects. Motion capture on location was achieved by using Dragon software on a laptop, which was in turn powered by a portable caravan battery. Cameras used were the Canon Eos 5 & 7.

After spending the last two years creating high profile remixes for the likes of Santigold, Gucci Mane, Radioclit and more, Mumdance (aka Jack Adams) is switching his focus to all original productions with the release of his debut EP, Mum Decent. 
 
Mumdance’s ability to interwork eclectic vocals by UK crooner Esser and grime MC Badness on top of production that spans continental influence is what ultimately has allowed his work to stand out amongst his peers. The three tracks that make up the Mum Decent EP follow this summer’s outstanding Different Circles mixtape and lay the groundwork for even more original production on forthcoming releases with Bonde Do Role, Toy Selectah, Brodinski and Drums of Death. In the perfect marriage of worldly inspiration and hip influence, Mumdance will be on heavy rotation this fall.",2010-10-04T15:16:00-04:00,112148751,181,16078883,8,32253,320,https://i.vimeocdn.com/video/97900715_780x439.webp

A Short Animation Inspired by the Works of İlhan Koman 

Plato Art Space is proud to present Candaş Şişman’s video dedicated to famous sculptor İlhan Koman produced for the exhibition İlhan Koman: Hulda Festival, a Journey into Art and Science opening on the 22nd September, 2010.
İlhan Koman’s unique design approach in his form studies also inspires contemporary art works. The video installation Flux by young artist Candaş Şişman can be defined as a digital animation which is inspired from the structural features of some of İlhan Koman’s works like Pi, 3D Moebius, Whirlpool and To Infinity... A red circle, which is colored in reference to the red radiators of Ogre, is traced in a morphological transformation which re-interprets the formal approach of Koman’s works. The continuous movement sometimes connotes the formal characteristics of Pi, 3D Moebius, Whirlpool and To Infinity..., as well as the original formal interpretations of the design principles of the works . In Flux, Koman’s design process in the making of the Pi series has been treated as the emerging of a sphere from a two-dimensional circle by the principle of increasing the surface; and that simple direction is re-interpreted in digital medium. Thanks to this, in the digital animation an entirely different form serial that does not resemble Pi yet remaining its design principle can be followed through the flow of a circle to the sphere. As a conscious attitude of the artist, this work is not designed in a direct visual analogy with Koman’s works. During the animation, none of the moments of the transforming form look like Pi or 3D Moebius, however the subjective reading of Koman’s approach can be observed. 

With the integration of the sounds of various materials – which Koman used in his sculptures – Flux turns into an impressive spatial experience. Flux, also exemplifies that Koman’s work can be re-interpreted by the analysis and manipulation of form in the digital medium.",2010-09-29T11:26:12-04:00,842174823,283,15617471,28,43026,639,https://i.vimeocdn.com/video/94376114_780x439.webp

The choice of materials was driven by the desire to graphically represent the concepts of attraction and repulsion. The idea that graphic artists of all sorts attend events such as FOTB because they are inspired and therefore attracted to each other's work, while at the same time often competing in the same fields as peers, which represents the repulsion factor.

Dictaphone Parcel is an animation based on a sound recorded with a dictaphone travelling secretly inside a parcel. As the hidden recorder travels through the global mail system, from London to Helsinki, it captures the unexpected. We hear a mixture of abstract sounds, various types of transport and even discussions between the mail workers. The animation visualizes this journey by creating an imaginary documentary.

Dictaphone Parcel was awarded the Passion Pictures Prize in London, in February 2010.

Chirality is a scientific term describing a structure that is not identical to its mirror image. “Chiral” collects cinematic etudes, which develop various conceptual approaches in order to expand the two-dimensional image into space. They are projected onto a sculpture (510 x 260 x 370 cm) and a screen (250 x 200 cm) made from handmade Taiwanese paper and develop very different lives on these configurations of the same material. 

The amalgamation of volumetric lights sets ideas from Chinese calligraphy into motion and melts them with influences from European Art Informel as well as impasto painting to an abstract-organic sculpture. The installation is completed by a soundtrack by Austrian composer Richard Eigner (www.ritornell.at). With the premiere in MOCA Taipei the first iteration of the long-term project was presented…

Augmented Reality (AR) is an emerging technology defined by its ability to overlay physical space with information. It is part of a paradigm shift that succeeds Virtual Reality; instead of disembodied occupation of virtual worlds, the physical and virtual are seen together as a contiguous, layered and dynamic whole. It may lead to a world where media is indistinguishable from 'reality'. The spatial organisation of data has important implications for architecture, as we re-evaluate the city as an immersive human-computer interface.",2010-08-20T09:33:48-04:00,256271819,166,15538550,17,56329,917,https://i.vimeocdn.com/video/93756575_780x439.webp

It is up to each individual creator to pick the style and media they want to work in - and to decide how they think the story should evolve.""

I was especially happy as this project gave me the opportunity to animate ducks getting shot in the head and celestial bear rays.  I also got to use songbird sounds for a duck.  That was fun.

3316,12584289,‘YEKPARE’ (monolithic),"""Yekpare"" is a storyteller which narrates the 8500 year story of Istanbul. The story embraces symbols from Pagans to Roman Empire, from Byzantine Empire to Latin Empire, and finally from Ottoman Empire to Istanbul at the present day.

Haydarpaşa Train Station, with its brilliant architectural forms, is the building on which the story is projected. The connection between middle east to west has been provided by Istanbul and Haydarpaşa since 1906. In the 50’s it served as a door for millions of internal emigrants who have triggered the chaos in Istanbul's dialectical daily life scenes.The project's conceptual, political and geographical positioning, the location’s depth of field and the fact that the entire show can be watched from Kadıköy coast; make ""Yekpare"" a dramatic presentation.

The first day of the performance also marks the 47th deathday of Nazım Hikmet Ran, the famous Turkish poet. We started out with a quote from his epic novel, ""Human Landscapes from My Country"": “At Haydarpaşa Train Station, in the spring of 1941, it is three o’clock. Sun, exhaustion and rush lay on the stairs...”

Old overtops young, many assimilates few, army oppresses civilian, society absorbs individual… All of this happen because of the norms which is formed by society. Individuals limited by the norms are captivated to cages of the society without being able to form their personality. Society absorbs individuals and makes them same samples of a prototype, if it cannot absorb individuals, it excludes or destroys them. The individuals have two choices: to live in a “normal” way, according to the other members of the society, without being themselves or to perish by being themselves.

	Büyüğün küçüğe üstünlük kurması, çoğun azı sindirmesi, askerin sivile baskısı, toplumun bireyi içine çekmesi… Bunların hepsi insanların kendi yarattığı normlar yoluyla gerçekleşiyor.  Normların sınırladığı bireyler kendi benliklerini yaşayamadan, toplum hapishanelerine kapatılıyorlar. Toplum içine çekebildiğini tek tip yapar, çekemediğini dışlar, yok eder. Bireylerin iki seçimi; diğerlerine karışıp kendi olmayarak, diğerlerine göre  “normal” olarak yaşamayı seçmek ya da kendi olup yok olmak.

3318,9696629,Cannonball,"Some of them are full of black water.  Others have become graveyards for old lawn furniture and rodent carcasses. They are shaped like jelly beans and manufactured by companies named Sunny Side and Champagne. Once upon a time, Fresno was the California Dream.  Own a car. Own a house.  Own a pool.  Everyone wanted it and the wonderful world of credit made it all possible.  But now, with the foreclosure monster running wild, the dream is dry. Thousands of pools are festering in the hot Central Valley sun.  For most people this is tragic.  But for some, it’s an opportunity.

3319,12772935,Coalition Of The Willing,"'Coalition of the Willing' is a collaborative animated film and web-based event about an online war against global warming in a 'post Copenhagen' world.

‘Coalition of the Willing’ has been Directed and produced by Knife Party, written by Tim Rayner and crafted by a network of 24 artists from around the world using varied and eclectic film making techniques. Collaborators include some of the world’s top moving image talent, such as Decoy, World Leaders and Parasol Island. 

The film offers a response to the major problem of our time: how to galvanize and enlist the global publics in the fight against global warming. This optimistic and principled film explores how we could use new Internet technologies to leverage the powers of activists, experts, and ordinary citizens in collaborative ventures to combat climate change. Through analyses of swarm activity and social revolution, 'Coalition of the Willing' makes a compelling case for the new online activism and explains how to hand the fight against global warming to the people.

WildWater is a journey into the mind and soul of whitewater, into the places only river runners can go, places of discovery, solitude and risk. Its a visually stunning feast for the senses, and an expedition into new ideas. We set out to create a new kind of adventure film. One where image, sound and ideas trump all else. We wanted to communicate the essence of the thing we love - wildness and whitewater - and put its soul on film. A tall order. After thousands of hours of effort in around the world and in our studio, we are now editing the full version of a film we call WildWater, and we have achieved much of the goal. Borrowing Hollywood film tools and techniques, including RED digital cinema cameras and high speed film, WildWater brings not only new perspectives, but new images to kayaking and the world of adventure cinema.",2010-06-14T15:52:43-04:00,56409204,125,9531245,11,23370,528,https://i.vimeocdn.com/video/47452860_780x439.webp

C’était le début de l’été a Buenos Aires. La ville s’était déjà un peu vidée, mais il y avait encore assez d’énergie pour facilement trouver 2 ou 3 concerts chaque soir dans différents coins de la ville. Il fallait en voir autant que possible lors de ces premiers jours de recherche sonore, se garder la première semaine pour écouter et la seconde pour filmer.

Tomi Lebrero jouait un de ces soirs dans un bel appartement qui accueillait a rythme régulier toute une famille de musiciens folks du coin. La nuit en bonne compagnie porteño était déjà bien avancée, l’alcool irriguait les dernières chansons, et le lendemain une seule mélodie me restait en tête, une ultime mélodie que la salle entière s’était mis a chanter a tue-tete.

Lorsque l’on voyage pour de longs mois, tout rapport aux objets et aux souvenirs prend une autre dimension. On ne peut rien garder, rien rajouter a son sac, si ce n’est en jetant un autre élément. Cette nécessité d’être précis dans ses choix s’applique aussi aux expériences que l’on mène chaque jour, aux petites aventures que l’on met en jeu et dans lesquelles on engage l’espace de quelques minutes, de quelques heures d’autres personnes. Mais voila, et c’est le discours que je tenais a Tomi - je voulais repartir de Buenos Aires avec cette mélodie dans mon sac. C’était plus important que tout a ce moment la, il le fallait.

Tomi était occupé, Tomi devait quitter la ville au plus tôt. Nos agendas ne pouvaient coller, je m’étais engagé sur trop d’autres tournages. Pourtant je ne voulais qu’une chanson, une seule, pour pouvoir l’emporter ailleurs et la partager avec d’autres amis et la chanter en choeur encore et encore.

C’était le mardi 2 février. Je courais a travers la ville pour filmer d’abord les amis du label ZZK, puis tenter une étrange expérience sonore avec Coso dans un ancien hôpital désaffecté de San Telmo. Tomi appelait alors. Il fallait que je reparte a l’autre bout de Buenos Aires au plus vite. Il m’avait donné une adresse dans Colegiales, me disait juste ’je vais te chanter la chanson’.

Les mois ont passé, j’ai voyagé dans d’autres coins du monde, et partout j’ai pu partager cette chanson. Tout semblait plus simple, et toutes ces quêtes sonores semblaient être résumé dans ces 7 minutes. Je pouvais voyager léger, j’avais sur moi en permanence un petit bout de vie qui faisait ’la la, lala la, la la...’.

3341,12075151,Waves,"A long piece of rope represents three dimensionally a series of waves floating in space, as well as producing sounds from the physical action of their movement: the rope which creates the volume also simultaneously creates the sound by cutting through the air, making up a single element.

Depending on how we may act in front of it, according to the number of observers and their movements, it will pass from a steady line without sound to chaotic shapes of irregular sounds (the more movement there is around the installation) through the different phases of sinusoidal waves and harmonic sounds.

But even though this could seem like a mere representation of what we can’t see for ourselves, beyond the persistence of vision, it connects with our most visceral side, combining the intangible beauty of the represented graphic with the brutality of the sound it produces, creating a hypnotic environment of audible results and unique visual stimulations.

it was incredibly hard picking a winner in this competition, as there were dozens and dozens of great videos to choose from. i chose this winning video based on it's creativity, production value, concept, and humor. thanks to everyone who entered, and i'm truly sorry that there couldn't be more than one winner, as they were all really good."" - Moby

""The video clip portrays the story of a girl who decides to invite Moby into her life. She attempts to do so by using the ""How to Summon Moby Guide for Dummies"", putting herself through 10 bizarre and comical steps (each is a tribute to a different Moby video). 

The video was created by film students from Tel Aviv University, Israel. We tried to capture the spirit of Moby and his iconic videoclips and hope we succeeded.

After spending 2 days at NAB listening to everybody talk about how great their cameras are, I decided I'd seen all of the 3D and DSLR cameras I could stand. I was plenty inspired by seeing capability of the camera I was carrying in my backpack, and decided I'd spend the next day actually shooting something. That night I went to Karaoke with some friends and the minute I met the Karaoke host I knew I had to do a documentary with him.

This was all sort of last minute, and I didn't really go to Vegas planning on shooting anything, but I'm happy I had my camera and that I got the chance to meet Billy Cash.

3374,11362882,Red Cafe - Heart and Soul of New York City by K1X,"Red Cafe & Pete Rock
""THE HEART & SOUL OF NEW YORK CITY""
A K1X film by Kevin Couliau 

Yes, it's about that time. Rain, sleet and snow have made way for the sun, long evenings and fresh sneakers. Early may, when Europe's hardwood champions have been crowned and the NBA playoffs shift into full gear, marks the inofficial start of the real basketball season: the streetball season! That's when reputations are made, nicknames are born and every ballplayer naturally gravitates towards that ""thump"", ""thump"" sound of his or her home court. Playground basketball is where it all started. Playground basketball is where talent is honed and friendships are made. It's where neighborhoods gather and where skills and sweat are a currency. That's especially true for the mecca of basketball, New York City. Nowhere else do streetball tournaments, players and games attract a quasi-religious following. Dollars, pride and bragging rights are on the line. Believe the hype! 

The idea for a visual love letter to NY basketball was born when Red Cafe's unreleased track ""Heart & Soul"" established itself as an instant office-favorite at K1X headquarters in Munich (Germany) last spring. Niels Jager (K1X Go-To Guy): ""The tune was on replay 24/7. And one day it hit us: let's build a statue for NYC streetball!"" Red Cafe's ode to the city that never sleeps is a Pete Rock production that boasts all the makings of a hip hop classic. K1X, who has been active in the outfitting of several high profile NYC streetball tournaments for several years, was all the more surprised to find out that this beast of a tune was not yet a prime focus of Red Cafe's record label. Shake Down quickly agreed to let K1X shoot a poetic clip for the song, whose lyrics are a glowing personification of K1X's appreciation for street basketball: The Heart & Soul of New York City. 

French streetball documentarist Kevin Couliau (Asphalt Chronicles), who spent the summer of 2009 in the five boroughs hunting down supreme blacktop action, was a natural choice to capture the raw essence of NYC and its rich streetball culture. As was the Canon 5D Mark II as Couliau's weapon of choice. Art director / director / producer Thibaut de Longeville (director of the acclaimed ""Just For Kicks"" sneaker culture documentary) and motion graphic designer Vincent Dumond of 360 Creative in Paris added their visual expertise to the project and took care of elegant motion graphics and bona fide post production. 

The outcome of this work will celebrate its world premiere on May 1st 2010 on k1x.com. The clip features action from K1X affiliated tournaments in Harlem (""Together We Chill"" and ""Kingdome Classic"") and the Lower East Side (""Lower Manhattan Classic"") as well as a variety of other city courts and an impressive array of cameos by iconic players, opinion leading heads and a bunch of regular dudes. Bobbito Garcia, who got an early preview of the clip last winter had this to say: ""It's so beautiful, man. It's snowing tonight but it made me look forward to the coming summer months again.""

World Premiere: Witness ""The Heart & Soul of New York City"" on May 1st 2010 on k1x.com!

3376,11374425,The Dancer,"www.thedancerfilm.com

Winner of 12 awards including the Grand Jury Award at San Francisco International Festival of Short Films.  The Dancer is the true story of Satish Kumar, an 11-year-old orpan boy living in India.  Satish is a non-actor who portrays himself and gives us unrestricted access into his world.
 
Shot on location in Dowlaiswaram, India, the film was produced to raise awareness about homeless and abandoned children in India’s remote Andhra Pradesh region. Satish and his friends live at Grace Children’s Home and speak only Telugu.
 
All dialogue was based solely on interviews with Satish, and direction was through a translator. Despite the communication barrier, a connection was made during production that transcends language and inspired all involved in this whirlwind project.  

Shot over a 4-day period by Seth Stark and Joshua Jouppi in 2010.

In Telugu with English subtitles.

3379,11229946,Lights Out,"This is a little animation I've been tinkering around with for a while. The original incarnation was designed for the Piranhabar reception desk which spanned 3 HDTV's so it was wiiiiiiiide. This version is a little easier to swallow on a single screen. 

It follows a little robotic character who's just trying to grab some shut-eye but the factory around him springs to life unexpectedly. A serious design flaw in the factories ergonomics prevents the poor guy from reaching the off switch and the rest is history! 

I pretty much did everything you see and hear here. Visuals were done in XSI, comping and grading in After Effects and sound was done in Premiere. Sound design purely based on sound effects was a new venture for me so I hope the result sounds ok!

Un mur d’eau événementiel a été installé en plein coeur de Paris et a délivré pendant une semaine des messages provoquant la prise de conscience des passants sur les dégats causés par l’eau non-potable dans le monde.

http://jasoneppink.com/astoria-scum-river-bridge
http://bladediary.com/tag/astoria-scum-river-bridge

For more than twenty years, a leaky pipe on 33rd Street beneath the Hell Gate Bridge viaduct approach submerged more than a hundred square feet of heavily-trafficked sidewalk under a festering cesspool of standing water. Astoria Scum River, as it was called, stretched the entire width of the sidewalk, and as winter approached, the river iced over and became particularly hazardous to cross.

Astoria Scum River Bridge was constructed to offer Astorians an opportunity to safely cross this hazard. The unauthorized bridge was a gift to the pedestrians of Astoria in the absence of successful municipal efforts to ameliorate the problem.

The bridge was made at zero cost entirely from recycled materials: an old work bench found on the curb, rescued screws from a disassembled desk, and a metal plate from an expired electrical component. It was installed and dedicated on December 30th, 2009.

On January 25th, 2010, Astoria Scum River Bridge was the subject of a commendation from the office of NYC Council Member Peter F. Vallone, Jr., accompanied by a pledge to work with Amtrak to re-route Astoria Scum River off the sidewalk.

Two days later, Amtrak workers began construction work. Astoria Scum River was quickly routed off the sidewalk, and within a couple months, custom-made grates were installed to complete the project. The bridge, no longer needed, was de-installed on March 20th, 2010 and returned to the curb whence it came.",2010-04-04T20:44:40-04:00,105503756,145,11718371,84,39544,651,https://i.vimeocdn.com/video/64960203_780x439.webp

John Frum, Messiah of polynesian Cargo Cults, returns as an astronaut and businessman to the postindustrial wasteland of the financial-service-economy. Together with a native, he sets out for a ""conquest of the useless"" — or something.^-^
then things get confused, and what begins as a journey turns into a trip far off the boundaries of so called ""logic"" and ""meaning"".
With a storyline initially based on the prophecies of the seemingly most syncretic, ridiculous and pointless religion in the world — though really not any more syncretic, ridiculous and pointless than any and all other religions — computer-aided handdrawn 2D animation and 2D-3D-hybrid background art celebrate a renaissance of the unconscious, free from the technocratic structuralism of our times.

Nokta . (Dot .) is an abstract short film project which is an improvisation of organic pieces and themes like power, control and luck. Using low-budget equipment and with the combination of actual camera shooting, 2d and 3d animation techniques, the film alters the reality and physics of the real world with the help of the liquid and dynamic simulations’ impact.

Even though the film is not produced according to the base of Amos Funkenstein’s text on harmony, but the text is a convenient statement for the stylistic and representational behaviour of the film.

'I see some correspondence between the foundation of universal harmony on elliptical orbit and the predilection for the elliptic forms in Baroque architecture. In both cases harmony is still defined as unity within multiplicity, but it ceased to be static, namely, harmony expressed in one ideal geometrical form, and became so to speak dynamic. What was previously regarded as the deviation from the ideal form, was comprehended for the first time as an integral part of the form, or form  of forms, which are capable of endless transitions one into another.

On the Role of Hypothetical Reasoning in the Emergence of Copernican Astronomy and Galilean Mechanics.]",2010-03-02T10:11:43-05:00,141458800,85,10821312,80,812387,1138,https://i.vimeocdn.com/video/58129427_780x439.webp

Kubiki 
(The Blocks)

If you imagine that the whole world is a house, then the fabled, toy death would be dwelling in the basement, which is also part of the house that God built. Under the basement, though, there would be a trench that not God, Father of the preset Father, dug, but a cursed, unknown old man, who had died before the Son was born. 

Since a time before memory existed, the cadaverous organism of Foredeath has been residing in this tomb, and even God has no power over it. 

There are no words to describe the blasphemy inflicted upon people, committed in that inconceivable absolute darkness, with not a single bright atom. 

Fyodorov understood at once and forever that everybody would die, and that he, Fyodor, would also die, and this is the worst thing that could ever happen. 

Alphabet blocks with multi-colored letters revealed to Fyodorov the awful mystery.  When his Babylon made out of wooden blocks toppled into pieces, the letters formed the Eternal Word. And the Word was uttered, and it was the truth about death. 

No adult would ever bear the burden of such a revelation. Fyodorov managed to compose himself, he withstood, and only occasionally would he burst into tears, and then…nobody could calm him down, neither his mother and grandmother, nor the doctors with their hallucinatory medicine. 

Human life is like running through a minefield, where mines are planted not only in the ground, but also in the clouds, beetles, flies, grasshoppers, mist, in the rustling of grass stems or in the ringing from faraway bell towers. 

Everywhere were many special traps, and though not all of them were instantly fatal, each one brought the end closer. 

The traps were guarded by the Beasts. Fyodorov learned about the Beasts from the prayers his grandmother would sometimes read, asking to be saved from the Aphid and from the mental Wolf. 

Fyodorov himself never saw the Beasts, but he imagined them very clearly. Once you might be caught off and not notice that the Mental Wolf had devoured the former meaning of things, and the Aphid had infected you with the deadly decay and turned you into Carrion, which is the Sin. 

If a man is full of sinful Carrion, he dies. What made Fyodorov different from other people was that he learned to create antidote rituals – acts, supported by a short prayer, as dictated by the blocks. 

To leave the apartment safely, Fyodorov would stroke the door knob five times and say Rock-a-bye, baby. If a stranger or an old woman with a poodle appears, he would return home, walking backwards. He would run into the kitchen, touch the table, press his cheek to the fridge, and only after all that did he stroke the door knob… by no means saying “Rock-a-bye, baby” because the baby is not rocking anymore. Instead, you should say: “Riddance, riddance – good riddance.”

At some point Fyodorov stopped going outdoors. At first he allowed himself to look out of the window, but soon he closed the curtains forever, to limit the influx of images. 

The Beasts were not dozing. The Wolf gobbled the meaning of bread and water – the last bits of Fyodorov’s poor rations, and the Aphid turned them into Carrion immediately. 

Then the fatal moment came, when Fyodorov didn’t manage to reach for the blocks. The Mental Wolf and the Aphid were patiently waiting for their prey…

… But the essence is unknown to The Beasts. In Fyodorov’d end is hidden the great defeat of Foredeath, because Foredeath has no right to him. Of all living creatures he is the only one not contaminated by the cadaverous organism of carrion, but instead filled with the Eternal Word.
And when Fyodorov ‘s spirit leaves him, a new realm of death will expand in the black emptiness left behind. This new realm will be stretched as a net over the former, and it will catch everyone. From then on everybody will be dying into Fyodorov’s death. Nobody knows what it will exactly feel like, but even if we are reincarnated as simple alphabet blocks with coloured letters, at least no one will ever get us or trouble us – not the mad old man, not Father, the Mental Wolf nor the Aphid.

3455,9378525,DanseDance,"Each day, we are surrounded by seemingly insignificant objects, taking them from one place to the other, or leaving them on a table for weeks, without paying any attention to them. We ignore or forget them, using things only when we need to, making sure they don’t interfere or inhabit our space. But what if they were not so stable and subservient? What if they could swivel, bounce or even fly. And what if they did so all at the same time? 

We want to imagine a place where objects could live and move, harmoniously, and of their own accord. Without interfering with each other these objects would bounce, roll, turn and cross each other’s paths.

This experiment is about re-discovering our daily surroundings. 

This is the making of the interactive video that was originally made for If You Could Collaborate exhibition. Each object is assigned to a letter on the keyboard, and can be activated or deactivated at any time. The online version will be soon available to play with at dansedance.com

Music & Sound Design :  François Montmayeur
Voices : Fons Schiedon, Henrik Kring, Laurent Nicolas, Paulo Muppet, Luciana Eguti, Pedro eboli, Antonio Linhares, William Iamazi Ferro.

Yves Geleyn collaborates with illustrator Remy Tornior on a short film, Pirates!!! The Curse of the Evil Eye, a tale set on the high seas, about an epic battle of good against evil. Yves, having always been a huge fan of Remy’s work, wanted to work on a project with him for some time. Then a joke about a Cyclops sparked the idea for the animation and the story began to take shape. Starting in September of 2006 and finishing in February of 2010, averaging about 52 seconds of animation per year, it was a true labor of love. Yves and Remy had no budget for this project and worked on the film in any spare moment they could find.

The concept of this piece was to mix the two worlds of Yves and Remy. With great attention to detail, Yves created the background and models, while Remy designed the characters. They bought two model ships on eBay, which Yves shot against a blue screen. Next, he meticulously added all the elements, animated Remy's designs and composited everything together. Then, they turned to Francois Montmayeur, currently a musician at L'Opera de Lyon, to create an epic score and sound design to create a truly cinematic experience.

Yves took a realistic approach when it came to the voices: he wanted Dutch voices for the Dutch boat and a more international mélange for the pirate crew (Japanese, Brazilian, French, Danish). To achieve this, he recruited the help of all his director friends from around the world who played along and sent him a collection of voices to inhabit this nautical adventure. With humor, love and a good deal of patience, Yves and Remy are extremely excited to be able to share  their short film, Pirates!!! The Curse of the Evil Eye.

""Line"" is a full CG student short film we created for our master thesis graduation 
in ""Arts et Technologies de l'Image"", at university Paris 8.


We did not try to create CGI human characters, so the foot (at 00:46) is the only live action element of our short film. Our goal was to suggest human presences through offscreen and sound design work. 

We could say that 99% of the film is computer graphic made. We primarily used Maya and Fusion.  We wanted to do in CG both hyper-realistic elements (sets / props) and other more graphic / poetry (the black characters)

It is an audiovisual composition that is based on a single set of MIDI notes. Those notes influence both music and graphics at the same time. We did not take the usual route of creating a piece of music first and then find some visualization for it; instead both elements have been developed at the same time. When we decided to change something with the graphics, the changes immediately influenced the music as well.

Make sure to read the information at the end of this video but basically me and DJT decided to walk a portion of Yonge Street in Toronto Canada. We started at around 9 am at the intersection of Wellington St and Yonge St in Aurora and we walked south along Yonge until we hit the end at Lake Ontario about 14 hours later. Where we ended up in the video is actually where Yonge St begins. To make our walk even more strange and interesting, I decided to do it in stopmotion, since stopmotion is what I like to do, so basically I would walk, stop and have my picture taken by DJT, as well as take his picture, so we have 2 sides captured. This was extremely tedious as you can imagine, we had thousands of pictures each, as we walked over 42 kilometers or 26 miles in 14 hours. There were many strangers wondering what on Earth we were doing taking each others pictures, we had no time to stop and explain so we made this video, which should do a better job. The next day, was a day I would not forget, having not really trained to walk so much in one day, our feet were ready to fall off, and we spent the whole day recovering on our soft sofas. Hope you enjoy this video, as it was hard to make but fun none the less and has me thinking bigger things.",2009-10-21T18:17:08-04:00,48824728,204,3116167,216,521034,5074,https://i.vimeocdn.com/video/450983611_780x439.webp

3485,8833777,Cracker Bag,"Eddie spends her pocket money obsessively hoarding fireworks and carefully planning for cracker night. When it finally it arrives, Eddie and her family head to the local football oval. In the frosty air Eddie lights the fuse of her first cracker and experiences a pivotal moment, one of the seemingly small experiences of childhood, that affects us for the rest of our lives. 

Set in the 1980s, Cracker Bag is a gentle suburban observation which subtly reflects a disenchanting prelude to the coming of age.

3498,2669327,_grau | 10:01 min | d 2004,"_grau is a personal reflection on memories coming up during a car accident, where past events emerge, fuse, erode and finally vanish ethereally … various real sources where distorted, filtered and fitted into a sculptural structure to create not a plain abstract, but a very private snapshot of a whole life within its last seconds … 

Media critic Matt Hanson, author of The End of Celluloid and founder of onedotzero festival says: ""_grau appeals to me because it is organo-tech. it does not deliberately ape the abstract pioneers of abstract cinema, and it is worlds away from the motion graphic masturbation of many of those enamoured by digital animation. seidel's work is impressionistic, melding biological and emotional currents. out of amorphous shapes we make out bones, heads, a hand. a spirit leaving the body. at least, this is what i sense out of the chaos of galactic reconfigurations, neurological connections, and biological forms. this is a powerful piece of digital animation precisely because it does not feel like such, it feels emotional, epic. and once you release the background to the animation--communicating a 'coming to terms' with the aftermath of a car accident--you realise why.""

3506,8118831,Experience Mobile Mobile,"Lost Boys (an Interactive Agency) invited me to do something for their agency Christmas card.

We took this as an opportunity to reinterpret the Christmas tree and its role as the traditional focal point for a communal space.  'Mobile Mobile' is a six metre circumference interactive sculpture, and signature piece for the entrance of the Lost Boys London Brick Lane studio. 

To cut a long story short, after a company-wide upgrade the agency had a lot of old mobiles gathering dust. We took these, built and hoisted a gigantic interactive chandelier/mobile that plays Christmas jingles in their reception.

To add a little xmas spice to the mix, anyone could go online, compose and play their own jingle (and enjoy annoying the hell out of people waiting around in the reception).  This was achieved by playing the thing live, using your computer keyboard from a web browser.

Details on how we made it and some behind the scenes content are available on my blog: http://www.theophane.co.uk/mobile-mobile

Mobile Mobile has been made as a semi-permanent hanging (exhibition) space.  In January the mobiles will be replaced with another hanging media, then updated month in, month out.  

Mobile Mobile is just one in a line of many great lo-fi art/build concepts; from the Design Museum's Aquarium, Digital By Design, Troika and The Cloud, the Printer Bleeping Thingy (I can't remember who did it), all the great work by W+K, and of course, AKQA's wonderful microwaves from last Christmas.  

Looking forward to many more to come.

Aloha all, just wanted to post a little footage from Jaws today...These waves are insanely huge and I have so much respect for the surfers that have the guts to do this as well as the jet ski operators that are tremendously talented in their own right, many of them big wave riders as well.. 

Anyhow, I live a couple of miles from Jaws on W.Kuiaha in a little town called Haiku. At night I can hear these monsters breaking, they sound like thunder...

One of the Jaws pioneers is Laird Hamilton. His wife Gabrielle Reece had this to say on his blog today.. 

""12-7-09 Swell Update from Laird

Gabby:
12-7-09
3:50 Hawaii Time

I just spoke to Laird around 3pm Hawaii time (5pm PST) from Maui.  He said they had a good morning and that his board and body were feeling good.  They went out fairly early, and it had not gotten too crowded yet.  The boys (Dave Kalama, Terry Chun, Derrick Doerner and others) came in for gas fuel and food fuel for lunch.  By then a front had come in and “chop sueyed” the waves.  Laird then proceeded to watch some of the action from the cliff side.  He said a lot of skis went up on to the rocks along with some boards.  He felt like there may have been several new comers who were having to work it all out.

I’m on Kauai and Kings reef began to break ever so slightly.  The ocean floor by this reef is so deep that you don’t even see Kings unless it’s starting to be Hawaiian 25 ft (that’s double in the front).

The boys are going to sit tight on Maui and then make their plan for tomorrow.  As most of you know the swell hits Kauai first, then Oahu (which is having a bit of rain and some major water surging), Maui and so on.  Once they get a beat on the conditions (wind, swell) they will most likely decide to continue to stay on Maui and surf Peah’i (aka Jaws) tomorrow.  If I hear anything of interest I will let you all know.""

3522,8168069,"Senegal, Africa, Through My Eyes","Wow, I had no idea that this many people would watch this video. The other day it screened twice in front of about 2,000 people at the Snoqualmie Casino, WA. Honestly, this video is pretty light weight, because it doesn't truly exemplify the issues that we can prevent. I didn't choose to talk about the starving fly children that you always see on TV and then ignore, or their irrigation problems, wells, or how they burn their fields just so they can fertilize the soil and plant new agriculture.

This video is about happiness.

It's now been 6 months since I have been to Africa. I miss it very much, because as the days count, I continually forget the impact it has in my life. When I plan my vacations to Hawaii, when I am upset because Urban Outfitters doesn't have a size Medium and I have to go to another store that's 15 minutes away, when my skis need waxing, when a season of Dexter or Entourage is over, when my bread from Trader Joes goes bad after 4 days I have to go exchange it... the frustrations we face aren't equatable.

One could argue, we aren't less happy, but I think we are more frustrated.

I made this video so I could remember, and so others who have no idea what it feels like may be able to empathize, and smile at the same time.

""Maybe one morning, walking in dry, glassy air,
I’ll turn, and see the miracle occur:
nothing at my back, the void

then, as if on a screen, trees houses hills
will suddenly collect for the usual illusion.
But it will be too late; and I’ll walk on silent
among the men who don’t look back, with my secret.""

3546,5010187,The Origin of Mass,"This experimental video was created as a final project for my procedural animation course at Savannah College of Art and Design. http://scad.edu It was inspired by demoscene and sub-atomic particle collision images. The name comes from the Higgs Boson prticle which is expected to provide a scientific foundation for the origin of mass in the universe.

My special thanks goes to professor Ronald Bernard and Puryx aka Christian Rønde who let me use his music for the soundtrack originally created for a demo called Nucleophile http://bit.ly/aErBrg

3547,7722804,Looping Around The House,"More long delaying than looping really. Loses its way a little at the toaster, but somehow claws it back. It was pretty hard looping like this because every timing error made was amplified each time round, so that in the end the loops were totally out of sync with the metronome in my ear!

I broke a couple of things when I was making this. But mum shrank a good jumper of mine a few days before, so we decided to call it even. It was a GREAT jumper though...

The good news is that mum and dad got a new toaster and it has a button on the side that, when pressed, makes the bread gently lower into the toaster and some shiny doors slide across to keep the heat in so it's more efficient. It makes toast more exciting, which, if you have it with something like blueberry jam, is almost TOO exciting.

3552,7286652,Colorama - Makeover,"Client: Colorama
Agency: McCann Malmö
Direction: Upper First
Director of Photography: Keith Loutit
Production: Upper First
Sound design: Kungen & Hertigen
Year: 2009

The idea is based on a technique called tilt-shift, combined with time-lapse (developed by Keith Loutit). It makes reality appear as a miniature model moving with a stop-motion flow. The thought is to create a visually interesting expression that give the audience something out of the ordinary, while at the same time providing a good overview of events. We would shoot from a high angle using specially developed lenses with a short depth of field. The fact that the world appears to be miniature makes the viewer think ”is it for real or not”. It is hard to tear your eyes from the images, something that works well for our purpose.

A gigantic hand will appear in the middle of events helping the workers to get the house ready for summer. It will light the barbeque with a magnifying glass for example. The idea is to create a visually absurd situation using displacement of scale between the people in frame and the giant hand. It is meant to underline the contrast of small and big, where the hand symbolizes the consumers ability to effect the environment and in the extension his or her own environment. Through time-lapse we’ll reinforce the ”before and after” scenario as you’ll be able to see small changes appear quickly. The film will start in a winter worn backyard and in 30 seconds evolve to a wonderful summer barbeque.",2009-10-27T08:49:29-04:00,631780950,30,4456674,21,46339,957,https://i.vimeocdn.com/video/10830833_780x439.webp

3588,6974132,THE MACHINE,"DIRECTOR  Rob Shaw
ANIMATION STUDIO  Bent Image Lab


""The Machine"" is an animated fable following the path of an innocently forged mechanical creature. As his independence and knowledge of the world grows on his journey, as does his desire to conquer all that we encounters, from the pastures of a farmer to the realm of man's entire world. 

The story is in itself a mechanized apparition, the characters and scenery exisiting inside of an early 20th century nickel arcade and being driven forward by the gears of this machine. 

The main character, the innocently created, human like mechanism whose power knows no bounds, thinks of himself as invincible, that no man or spirit could ever overpower him. Yet, the irony is that he himself is only a small part of a greater device, and in this case, a mechanized stage for passers by to waste a nickel in.  

This film was shot over many hours at Bent Image Lab over the course of several months in 2008-2009. Animated using stop-motion puppets and sets, then composited together in After Effects, the film has a mixed media presence to it that is accentuated by the machine's own collage like form.

3597,6522727,Temporary Slaraffenland,"The bar was incredible from the outside—the Jernbanecafeen, a relic of the bygone 20th century, a cheap concert venue with dying Danish melodies played live. The perfect way to end our musical day, in warm surroundings and on the last leg of a well-planned day trip. We went in first to stall the meager crowd, allowing the local singer the ten-minute break that he needed, and the tension was palpable. Aarhus, Denmark’s second city, had just had its local soccer team slapped around, and five unfortunate young fans took refuge in the cafe to drown their sorrows in alcohol and angry songs. The fight happened not far away and the musicians didn’t get too involved, but the wrathful hymns stayed shattered behind the choir of our five Danish musicians and their guests. Just one hitch, then the day ended in a soft landing : the 10th song completed and filed away in an environment of quintessentially Scandinavian mellowness.

I met Slaraffenland about a year and a half ago, shortly after discovering their album Private Cinema in 2007. I wanted to do something with them, and ran into them the first time at SXSW in 2008 to do a shoot for a different (and pretty crappy) website ; we had them participate in a lovely musical piece with some of our other favorites, Stars Like Fleas. Our paths crossed again this year at SXSW, during a riskier musical and cinematographic attempt—kind of a super lo-fi mini Russian Ark. (Don’t miss the last five minutes—it’s worth waiting for.) They were two little experiences of musical cinema that led the Temporary Copenhagen/ Temporary Slaraffenland project, which was recorded in May 2009 in the Danish capital over the course of several days.

This is a 40-minute-long film, which was filmed somewhat along the lines of Beirut’s beautiful Flying Club Cup project—the goal being to simply extend a Take-Away Show session across an entire day (see more) and play all the songs off of a new album before its release, all in the places that inspired the musicians. To give an alternative version of the material, where the idea of perfection and final recording slips even farther away. To preserve the fleeting moments and the temporary spaces.


I had gone in search of this « new » Danish scene, mostly for the traces of Efterklang and Slaraffenland, wanting to document—in my own experimental way—the local creation. I came away, though, moved more by the openness of spirit than by the community of all these groups. I drew enough material to re-launch an old project, the one in Temporary Areas—and gained inspiration in how to explore the world through recording equipment, and what impact a camera can have in the course of events. Experimenting more than « documenting » in an objective sense.

3611,6496886,Sketch2Photo: Internet Image Montage,"Due to a name conflict with a Google SketchUp Plugin, we now change title to Sketch2Photo.
We present a system that composes a realistic picture from a simple
freehand sketch annotated with text labels. The composed picture
is generated by seamlessly stitching several photographs in agreement
with the sketch and text labels; these are found by searching
the Internet. Although online image search generates many inappropriate
results, our system is able to automatically select suitable
photographs to generate a high quality composition, using a filtering
scheme to exclude undesirable images. We also provide a novel
image blending algorithm to allow seamless image composition.
Each blending result is given a numeric score, allowing us to find

Written, Directed and Animated by: Kenneth Shofela Coker
Original score and Sound Design by: Michael Peery and Brian Truesby

This animation was completed for my graduation show at the Memphis College of Art in April 2009. Story boarded, animated, composited, and scored over a four month period using 3ds Max, Photoshop, Illustrator, Adobe After Effects, and Logic Pro.

The animation is based loosely on West African tree of life myths and legends that emphasize the cyclical nature of life and the universe. In Yoruba ""Iwa"" means strength of character.

In the clip, a pair of marbles—one blue, one yellow—engage in the timeless dance of seduction on a horizontal plain, mapping the ups and downs of a courtship through pencil-drawn geometric principles. Like Two Dots, Johnsons video lives in the middle ground between technology and humanity, emotional immediacy and obsessive detail.

3622,6654322,The Snail on the Slope,"The Snail on the Slope is a generative movie based on a book of the same title by Strugatsky brothers.  The novel is set on an unknown planet, where humans have a base from which they are investigating and trying to conquer the Forest. The Forest, which is a huge single organism is constantly changing and fighting back. It is also dangerous and there are a lot of unexplained phenomena that they are discovering. 

The movie is made of five chapters, which critically address the questions of artistic and scientific efforts to understand nature. The topics that arise in those chapters are: sublime view on nature, role of knowledge, ubiquitous bureaucracy, and destruction of nature.

In the movie, all the scenes are generated with Processing. They are created as abstractions and visualizations of the atmospheres in which all of the action takes place.

3635,6475819,No_keyframes,"""Inspired by MoGraph's new MoDynamics and the excellent possibilities offered by CINEMA 4D's XPresso and C.O.F.F.E.E. for creating complex setups we created the film 'No Keyframes', which is based entirely on automated setups. Each scene represents a specific functionality, which in itself generates interesting effects. The film shows spheres as they travel through various environments, interacting with elements in these environments and causing different reactions in each of them. Contrary to the approach taken in classic keyframe animation it was important to us to create self-sustaining models whose behavior was controlled by the rules of physics, similar to a real-world physical environment. The results often surprised even us. This film includes a wide spectrum of CINEMA 4D features, which are combined to make the resulting effects even more complex and interesting.""

Canon Philippines lent us a pre-production model of the 7d.  We got it Tuesday 6pm and had to return it the following Thursday at noon.

We wanted to document something truly Filipino and came up with the idea of shooting a ""Perya"".  There really is no direct equivalent in English. It's not as grand as a carnival, not as permanent and posh as an amusement park, there are no pumpkins nor cows in competition like a country fair.  It is what it is - a Perya.

3639,6475938,Dublin's People: Canon 7d 24p,"Filmed at the end of the 2 day F-Stop Academy Cinematography workshop in Dublin when we were in wind down mode. Shot on a pre-production Canon 7d.

I took the Canon 7d, Zacuto Tactical rig, Z-Finder V2 and one lone lens, a Canon 35mm f1.4, which becomes more like a 50mm lens on the 7d. So a bit like what I did with Sofia's People (but I didn't have the Zacuto rig for that).

I shot 1/50th of a second as I was shooting 24p and to match the 50hz frequency of the artificial all around me in Temple Bar.

I also shot some stuff 720p 50p with shutter at 1/100th to get the slow motion shots of the juggler which were conformed to 23.98p in Cinema tools to create the beautiful slow motion. 

Sound on the last bit was just the internal mono cam mic as I didn't want a big mic on top of the camera.

Big thanks To Darragh and Emma for organizing the workshop. To all the people attended and especially the people who came to the intensive 1 day Cinematography practical workshop on Sunday. Jala (from Germany), Cathal (from N. Ireland) and Jean-Jacques (from France) stayed on another night and joined me for the night shooting. We had a great time. You may also spot my partner in crime Den Lennie a couple of times here. 

Music is appropriately by the great THIN LIZZY and is of course Whiskey In The Jar.

Minor colour balance grading was done. That's all to take out the yellow of the sodium lights. 

Smoking may look cool on camera kids but it's bad for you! The reason so many smokers in this? All the smokers are outside, all the non smokers are inside due to smoking ban. I hope you notice the one in my mouth was not lit! :-)

It was a great challenge and a lot of fun. 

After a lot of hard work, we are quite proud to see the initial sketches come alive.

In this video you can see the comparison from set to screen.

Is your inner peace an utopian state until you have finally escaped the grip of the society and its rules? Or is affirmation a faster way to your personal luck? And what are you supposed to do, if you have to answer this question at the age of 12?

In the Animated Short ""The Forest"" by David Scharf, the protagonist has to cope with this question and her hostile environment and finds a simple but radical solution.

3654,5313987, FIA GT3 VIDEO BATTLE,"As someone who spends most of his time working with different types of creative people, I do enjoy getting involved with young, talented artists in order to help them get their careers going. I'm in the unique position of being to help creative people from time to time and see this as an opportunity to give back to the world and pay off some karmic debts, if that makes sense.

So last month, the option came up for us to take drift film-maker Will Roegge to a FIA GT Race in Italy. I was pretty curious to see what he would do at a high end European GT race and put his name forward to be one of the shooters for our NFS Drivers Film project with Spitfire Films.

The main NFS Drivers film will focus on the GT1 class, but we decided to make this little Speedhunters Mediascape style film of the GT3 races just for fun.

It features footage from Will Roegge, Tripp from Spitfire Films on the Red Camera and a materials from yours truly.

If you liked our recent Formula D: The Story So Far film then this new video will certainly tickle your fancy.

Enjoy!

This video was a joint effort from myself and Dave Kiss (http://www.vimeo.com/davekiss ) shot using a DIY 360 degree video camera rig that I built. It still needs some tweaking to eliminate the blind spots, but the results are still appealing.

The device constructed consists of four angled mirrors and four configuration plates, each covering a 90 degree view. We then mounted four HVX200 cameras to the plates, which shot upwards into the mirrors and captured the surrounding environment into separate files. The videos were stitched together in post, and flip-flopped to get the perspectives correct. Photos are below and to the right.

3709,4464887,Murmur Study,"Murmur Study is an installation that examines the rise of micro-messaging technologies such as Twitter and Facebook’s status update. One might describe these messages as a kind of digital small talk. But unlike water-cooler conversations, these fleeting thoughts are accumulated, archived and digitally-indexed by corporations. While the future of these archives remains to be seen, the sheer volume of publicly accessible personal — often emotional — expression should give us pause.

This installation consists of 30 thermal printers that continuously monitor Twitter for new messages containing variations on common emotional utterances. Messages containing hundreds of variations on words such as argh, meh, grrrr, oooo, ewww, and hmph, are printed as an endless waterfall of text accumulating in tangled piles below.

The printed thermal receipt paper is then reused in future projects and exhibitions or recycled.

Monetization is the ubiquitous buzz word for online video content. The fellas bring this age old debate to the foreground while discussing what works for online advertising and the overall structure of very different business plans. Everyone agrees that current advertising agencies need to start taking full advantage of the online space whether that is through sponsorship or creating social environments.

 “In order to survive when the TV giants decide to go “all out” online, you are going to have to have a set of partnerships, alliances and new content that constantly come into play,” says Mike Michuad.    

There are sites available that split advertising sales and host videos for free for content developers. But these sites may not allow you to have control over what ads are involved with the site. The network models or the strategy of going directly to B2B companies both have their own advantages, but the fellas disagree on who is doing it right.

“Social networking and community building are the future of advertising for local business,” explains Steve Weiss. The fellas do seem to agree on at least this one instance. 

Check out the recent webisode of FilmFellas and see who you side with.

3749,4749657,KLUGE,"Meet Nick Sambrato. He runs a print shop in Orlando, Florida called Mama's Sauce.

Nick isn't a very smart guy. At a time in history when the print industry is pouncing from one space-age technological advancement to the next, Nick has decided to take a giant leap backwards into the industrial revolution.

Meet the Kluge letterpress. An 2,000 pound, cast iron, electric powered monstrosity of vacillating rods, giant spinning wheels and pneumatic hoses. The Kluge is Nick's weapon of choice in his battle against the future.
So why does Nick use the Kluge? A clearly outdated, cumbersome and obsolete machine? The same reason any craftsman uses any tool: for the quality of the finished product. A letterpress offers a tangible, three-dimensional look and feel to the printed image that no other technology can replicate.

Let Nick take you on a trip back in time as he runs through the process of turning an ordinary piece of paper stock into work of art.

3775,4298315,Wave Machines - The Greatest Escape We Ever Made,"This is the music video for Wave Machine's track ""The Greatest Escape We Ever Made"", directed by Stuart Lanceley and produced by Token Films.

For this video, I rediscovered the joy and agony of stop-motion animation. It's the reason I first got into film-making.
I created a paper edit first, then shot the band with a Sony Z1 camcorder.
I edited this footage together in Final Cut Pro and then exported every frame as a TIFF. These stills were printed and cut out. It was then re-shot using the digital stills function on a Canon HV30 video camera before all the stills were brought back into FCP once again.
Et Voila!
Hope you enjoy it.
If you want to know more about the band, they have a free download and links to myspace, facebook etc. at http://www.wavemachines.co.uk

Many thanks to the wonderful people who helped me with the epic amount of animation necessary, I couldn't have kept going without you! Thanks also to the band for doing so much printing and cutting out, well done to you all!

3783,4180316,Fun with Extreme Slow Shutter in Currumbin Valley,"At the end of Currumbin Valley there is a National Park with paved walkways to boardwalks and lookouts to waterfalls and rock pools. 
I went up there to get a few shots and ran into a couple of mud clad hikers. They said, ""jump that fence and follow the river for about an hour and a bit. It's amazing. you'll get good shots there! And by the way there is no track.""

I thought, what the hell, and set off. Two hours later my ankles were covered in leeches, my boots full of water, and I discovered a miller tripod makes for a good walking stick. But at the end, I discovered a truly magical spot. So thanks to those hikers. I got to shoot for over an hour - in the middle of nowhere - miles from anyone or anywhere. Fantastic.

3785,1552092,Mountain Goats - Woke Up New (Directed by Rian Johnson),"A music video I directed for one of my favorite bands, The Mountain Goats.  We shot this in an apartment I had in New York in the middle of a heat wave, summer of 2006.  My AC broke on the first day of shooting.

This is how we did it: I diagrammed out 8 layers of video on a timeline.  We shot the first layer (of John's face on the tv screen sitting on the floor) then took that tape and played it back on my TV, and shot the second layer.  Then we took that tape and played it back, and shot the third.  Basically we built it layer by layer, live, and by the end of the two day shoot we had our finished video.

Sharp eyes will notice a few wonky match-dissolves.  We discovered that once we were 8 layers deep (that is, shooting off a tv screen off a tv screen off a tv screen 8 times) the deepest layer was too muddy to see what was going on.  So we used only 7 layers at the start, and transitioned to layer 8 when we needed it.

It gives a flavour of what is required when shooting with a 35mm adaptor, but also a glimpse into the world of Philip. His special humour is second to none and really made this a day to remember.

A special thank you to Philip, and to Steve at Zacuto. Philip was also helped by Suresh Kara from documovie.co.uk who was AC to Philip.
